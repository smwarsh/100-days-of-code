# Continuing Development - Log

### July 1, 2019

**Thoughts**: Took something like 3 months off of coding, but I can't let myself get complacent and not work on my personal development/career advancement. I came into work early to do some things for an hour. I'm so glad to be working out the kinks and getting back on track.

**Today's Progress**:
+ Updated broken link to my LinkedIn page on my website
+ Caught up on Twitter notifications; answered messages; tweeted
+ Caught up on LinkedIn; added some connections (Colleen Raimond, LGBTQ coordinator at UR; MC Martin, head of P&D/HR at GTO)
+ Updated broken LinkedIn link on my local copy of my website and pushed to GitHub ([website repo on GitHub](https://github.com/smwarsh/steph-warsh))
+ Updated MAMP to version 5.3

**Resources Used**:
+ [How to Update MAMP to New Version on Localhost?](https://www.webnots.com/how-to-update-mamp-to-new-version-on-localhost/)

**Next Steps**:
+ Convert my website to WordPress
  + Install WordPress locally so I can have a local version of my site ([How to Install WordPress Locally on Mac using MAMP](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-locally-on-mac-using-mamp/))
  + Set up a staging site for my website ([How to Easily Create a Staging Site for WordPress (Step by Step)](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-create-staging-environment-for-a-wordpress-site/))
