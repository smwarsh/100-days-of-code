# Continuing Development - Log

### July 1, 2019

**Thoughts**: Took something like 3 months off of coding, but I can't let myself get complacent and not work on my personal development/career advancement. I came into work early to do some things for an hour. I'm so glad to be working out the kinks and getting back on track.

### July 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
+ Checked LinkedIn and Twitter
+ Tried to edit Shapely in localhost but there's no content on the page when I try to edit it, even though it's filled with demo content?
+ I considered using the [Classic Editor plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/) but that doesn't seem sustainable. It's probably better to move forward with WordPress from the beginning so I don't have to do a big overhaul in 2 years
+ Talked to Ken and he gave me a theme, but turns out it's the Drupal one, so I considered buying [Pofo theme](http://preview.themeforest.net/item/pofo-creative-portfolio-and-blog-wordpress-theme/full_screen_preview/21023319?_ga=2.175255138.1329748979.1562676523-254394451.1562589196) but I'm going to move forward with free Shapely for now.
+ Found out how to get to the Shapely content - it's in the WordPress customizer thing, /steph-warsh-wp/wp-admin/customize.php

**Resources Used**:
+ [Shapely Demo Content](https://colorlib.com/wp/forums/topic/shapely-demo-content/)
+ [READ THIS FIRST WordPress 5.2 Master List](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/read-this-first-wordpress-5-2-master-list/)

**Next Steps**:
+ Convert my website to WordPress
  + Use the customize section to edit Shapely to have what I want
  + Edit the site to look like what I currently have, roughly
  + Make 2 blog pages using the categories trick? Or keep it all as one blog?
  

### July 11, 2019

**Thoughts**: I only had about half an hour today because I got in a little late and read an article before starting.

**Today's Progress**:
+ Checked LinkedIn and Twitter
+ Can't really figure out how to edit my site like I usually edit WordPress sites
+ Added the content of my blog posts, and that's about it

**Next Steps**:
+ Convert my website to WordPress
  + Edit Shapely to have what I want??? How?
  + Edit the site to look like what I currently have, roughly
  + Make 2 blog pages using the categories trick? Or keep it all as one blog?

**Eventually**:
+ Convert my website to WordPress
  + Set up a staging site for my website ([How to Easily Create a Staging Site for WordPress (Step by Step)](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-create-staging-environment-for-a-wordpress-site/))

### July 15, 2019

**Thoughts**: I'm super drowsy today, can't figure out how to get WordPress to look the way I know it, getting frustrated with that. I thought I knew how to export the content I'd worked on, but apparently not, and I'm too tired to look for a solution now.

**Today's Progress**:
+ Checked LinkedIn and Twitter
+ Changed content on home page of WP site for my site

**Next Steps**:
+ Figure out how to manipulate this theme


### July 16, 2019

**Thoughts**: Took something like 3 months off of coding, but I can't let myself get complacent and not work on my personal development/career advancement. I came into work early to do some things for an hour. I'm so glad to be working out the kinks and getting back on track.

**Today's Progress**:
+ Checked Twitter (tweeted!) and LinkedIn
+ Tried to figure out how to avoid the WYSIWYG editor, which is the only thing I've been able to find on this WP site
+ Found out that [WP Bakery Page Builder](https://wpbakery.com/) is actually a PAID plugin - $45! - so I'm going to see if I can take the file from one of my other projects

**Next Steps**:
+ Add WP Bakery plugin to site
