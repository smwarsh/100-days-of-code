# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Round 2

### R2D1: Fri December 14, 2018

**Today's progress**: I watched/did the "Saving Stores and Using Mixins" video from the Learn Node course.

**Time spent coding**: 55m

**Thoughts**: Where will this 100 days take me?

### R2D2: Sun December 16, 2018

**Today's progress**: I took notes on "Saving Stores and Using Mixins" and got to 5:30 in "Using Async Await" in the Learn Node course.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 1m

**Thoughts**: R2-D2! Beep boop. Today was kind of boring.

### R2D3: Mon December 17, 2018

**Today's progress**: I finished "Using Async Await" in the Learn Node course and got to 5:30 taking notes. I finished my coding notebook and found a new notebook to use.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: Trying to think of how I will implement all this in Thrift. I might have to take the starter files and adapt them to Thrift.

### R2D4: Tue December 18, 2018

**Today's progress**: I took notes up to 13:59 in "Using Async Await."

**Time spent coding**: 1h 3m

**Thoughts**: There is a lot to process in this video.

**Link to work**: [dang-thats-delicious repo](https://github.com/smwarsh/dang-thats-delicious)


### R2D5: Wed December 19, 2018

**Today's progress**: I finished taking notes on "Using Async Await," watched/did "Flash Messages," and got to 3:44 taking notes on the same.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 4m

**Thoughts**: Woo flashes. Still not the most exciting course.

**Link to work**: [dang-thats-delicious repo](https://github.com/smwarsh/dang-thats-delicious)


### R2D6: Fri December 21, 2018

**Today's progress**: I finished taking notes on "Flash Messages" and messaged Alex M about helping him with his website's design.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 5m

**Thoughts**: I hope Alex responds! I wonder if I should be working on Thrift along with this Node.js course, because I feel like I will need to redo the whole course when I want to adapt Thrift to this.

### R2D7: Sat December 22, 2018

**Today's progress**: I started "Querying our Database for Stores" then got a bunch of errors and reverted everything to the way it was before today. The errors are still there...

**Time spent coding**: 1h 12m

**Thoughts**: I'm pissed. I did nothing wrong; this started happening randomly. Clearing the cache in Chrome didn't work like it did for me last time. I don't know what to do.


### R2D8: Sun December 23, 2018

**Today's progress**: I very carefully went through "Querying our Database for Stores" and it all worked out today!

**Time spent coding**: 52m

**Thoughts**: I guess my computer needed some time to sleep on it.

**Link to work**: [dang-thats-delicious repo](https://github.com/smwarsh/dang-thats-delicious)


### R2D9: Wed December 26, 2018

**Today's progress**: I took notes on "Querying our Database for Stores." I also thought a lot about incorporating Node.js into Thrift.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 4m

**Thoughts**: I had a couple busy days with the holidays and didn't get to code on Christmas Eve or Christmas! But I'm back today, and I have a lot of questions about how I can start working on Thrift with all this Node.js stuff. I don't want to have to redo the entire course once I start working on Thrift, so maybe I can do it concurrently.


### R2D10: Thu December 27, 2018

**Today's progress**: I did research on how to start Thrift with the Learn Node starter files. I messaged Jared asking for guidance. I restarted the course for Thrift. I'm currently @ 4:04 in the "Setting Up MongoDB" video, just getting as far as I can to develop educated questions for Jared when I talk to him tomorrow. I scanned localhost and stephwarsh.com for open ports and took a screenshot of the results for localhost. The scan on stephwarsh.com went for 15 min without returning anything or finishing so I gave up. I don't know if there are any open ports on there anyway.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 22m

**Thoughts**: I did a bunch of different stuff today, prepping for getting Thrift going again. There's a lot I need to clear up.

**Link to work**: [Thrift repo](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D11: Fri December 28, 2018

**Today's progress**: I set up for my call with Jared and put some questions together, then I talked to him and got some questions answered!

**Time spent coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: I learned a lot from my call with Jared! One of those things is that I will definitely break things, as hard as I try not to, but it will make me a better programmer in the end. Also, there is specific software for deploying an app once it is completed. You don't just pop it in the FTP client like I thought you would. And, I learned that knowing Git is something I should do.

**Link to work**: [Thrift repo](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D12: Sat December 29, 2018

**Today's progress**: I researched, looking for good courses to learn Git quickly. I got to 1:27 in Lecture 7, "Pushing Your First Commit to GitHub," in this Udemy course, [Short and Sweet: Get Started with Git and GitHub Right Now](https://www.udemy.com/short-and-sweet-get-started-with-git-and-github-right-now/learn/v4/content), which I found from this article, "[Top 5 Free Courses to Learn Git and Github](https://hackernoon.com/top-5-free-courses-to-learn-git-and-github-best-of-lot-2f394c6533b0)."

**Time spent coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: I am learning surprisingly a lot from this course, and I think I will like the extra control I will get using the Terminal over GitHub Desktop.


### R2D13: Sun December 30, 2018

**Today's progress**: I finished the Git course, then I followed a link to an article, "[How you can learn Git and GitHub while youâ€™re learning to code](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-you-can-learn-git-and-github-while-youre-learning-to-code-7a592ea287ba)," that someone gave me on Twitter. I went through that, and I did the whole process of setting up an SSH key before finding out that it is already set up on my account. 7687 (That's from Jiji). I am now working through the "Clone your repositories" section.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 14m

**Thoughts**: There is a lot to do here, but I think I am learning it quickly. I feel guilty for not having a license on my repositories. I feel like I should at least look up the MIT license.

**Link to work**: [New Thrift repo](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D14: Tue January 1, 2019

**Today's progress**: I think I finished setting up the Thrift repository via the command line? I changed the username and password for Thrift in MongoDB

**Time spent coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: There were a lot of complications on the command line. Even though I deleted Thrift from GitHub, when I added it to GitHub again via the command line, it still had all my old commits there, including the files I newly put in .gitignore. So I had to delete the variables.env file with help from [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18393498/gitignore-all-the-ds-store-files-in-every-folder-and-subfolder), but the commit was still in my commit history, showing the database connection info and everything else for all to see. So I used [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/495345/how-to-remove-selected-commit-log-entries-from-a-git-repository-while-keeping-th) and [this article](http://web.archive.org/web/20100213104931/http://blog.madism.org/index.php/2007/09/09/138-git-awsome-ness-git-rebase-interactive) to try to delete it, but it didn't work. I got errors. So I gave up and changed the MongoDB username and password, so hopefully no one will be able to hack my project. Then, it turns out that the variables.env file got actually deleted from my local files, so I had to create it again and copy in the code from the deleted file. The good news is that now variables.env is on my computer but not showing up on GitHub! So I think I finally have that working. I'm starting to question that I ever deleted the Thrift respository like I thought I did. Why would everything still be there? I got a weird error when trying to connect my local Thrift repository to my remote repository on GitHub and used [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10904339/github-fatal-remote-origin-already-exists) to override the connection that was apparently already there.

**Link to work**: [Thrift repo](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D15: Wed January 2, 2019

**Today's progress**: I redid the whole Thrift repository thing (I deleted the repository, recreated it, and reinitialized it), then I posted a blog post about how to do this thing I've gone through 3+ times in Git. I also looked up GitHub licenses and decided "no license" is the one for me, for now.

**Time spent coding**: 2h 2m

**Thoughts**: Today was genuinely very enjoyable. I saw the opportunity for a blog post and I went for it. I didn't want to spend too much time on the styling, so I was pleased when the code snippets came out looking exactly like I wanted them to, first try. And now everything with the Thrift repository is fixed and reset, although sadly it deleted all the pretty green squares on my profile that have been tracking my GitHub activity for the past week or so.

### R2D16: Thu January 3, 2019

**Today's progress**: I changed moment to date-fns in the starter files I am using for Thrift. I finished the "Introduction and Setup" chapter of the Learn Node course for Thrift. I created the impressively large amount of node modules by running `npm install`. I spent the rest of the time fixing security vulnerabilities.

**Time spent coding**: 2h 20m

**Thoughts**: I truly went down the rabbit hole today. Wow. I hope I didn't break ~~everything~~ anything. I was especially nervous about the "breaking change" for fixing the security vulnerability in deep-extend (dependency of juice). But at the end of it all, it seems to be working?

**Link to work**: [Thrift repo (6 big commits today!)](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D17: Fri January 4, 2019

**Today's progress**: I got almost all the way through Module #2 Core Concepts in the Learn Node course today, working on Thrift this time. The next video (and last one in the module) is "Middleware and Error Handling." I mostly followed the videos but I adapted for how I want to use them and what I want to call them in Thrift.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 6m

**Thoughts**: I thought a bit about how I want Thrift to look in the end and what similarities & differences it will have from Dang That's Delicious, the Learn Node project. I wonder if I will add transactions on the page or have them added through a separate page? I would prefer the former but I have only learned how to do the latter. It's good that I've already done this part of the course, because it is easy to see what parts are applicable to Thrift and what parts I can skim through.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D18: Sat January 5, 2019

**Today's progress**: I watched/did "Creating our Store Model," following along for Thrift. I implemented the database schema for transactions, but I am hung up on the ID and how to make it auto increment in MongoDB, because it's not built in like it is in SQL.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 8m

**Thoughts**: I am not done noodling about the auto-increment ID, so here is a list of articles I have open that I want to continue looking at:
* [Stack Overflow: "Mongoose auto increment"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28357965/mongoose-auto-increment)
* [Hashnode: "What is the best way to generate auto incrementing ID in MongoDB?"](https://hashnode.com/post/what-is-the-best-way-to-generate-auto-incrementing-id-in-mongodb-ciibz8ege00l6j3xtx7c2kubm)
* [Tutorials Point: "MongoDB - Auto-Increment Sequence"](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb/mongodb_autoincrement_sequence.htm)
* [NPM mongodb-autoincrement - _I don't think this is what I'm looking for_](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-autoincrement)

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D19: Sun January 6, 2019

**Today's progress**: I looked through the articles for auto increment in MongoDB, then I did "Saving Stores and Using Mixins," following along for Thrift.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 3m

**Thoughts**: I moved on from looking at the articles because I can't test anything until I have more set up and can see if auto-incrementing actually works. So I kept following the videos and getting things set up for that.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D20: Mon January 7, 2019

**Today's progress**: I followed the "Using Async Await" video from the Learn Node course and set up Thrift to add things to the database. Then, I tested it and did some research on the ID situation.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 18m

**Thoughts**: I think I might not have to figure out auto-increment for the ID in MongoDB. I have an idea, and it involves using the auto-generated unique \_id field that every database item seems to have. I need to do some more investigation. Helpful pages that I have open:
* [StackOverflow: how do I search for an object by its ObjectId in the console?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8233014/how-do-i-search-for-an-object-by-its-objectid-in-the-console)
* [MongoDB: db.collection.find()](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.find/)
* [MongoDB: ObjectId](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/)

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D21: Tue January 8, 2019

**Today's progress**: I fought sleep and watched some videos from the Practical JavaScript course to figure out how to use the id of an item to edit/delete it.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 1m

**Thoughts**: I coded early today, after dropping Caitlin off at school! I didn't get much done because of my tiredness. It seems like I may have to wait until there is a page with a list of all the transactions on it before I start figuring out the delete capability. And maybe Wes Bos will even show me how to do it! Although I doubt he will show exactly what I'm looking for, he will probably give some helpful general information on the topic of deleting from MongoDB.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D22: Fri January 11, 2019

**Today's progress**: I watched Practical JavaScript Version 10 "Clicking delete should update todoList.todos and the DOM" and then started watching Learn Node\]]\\\\\\\ "Creating an Editing Flow for Stores" and got to 7:50. In between the two videos, I moved dang-thats-delicious from GitHub Desktop to using Git instead.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 0m]\\

**Thoughts**: I missed 2 days in a row and almost skipped today too. I'm tired and it's late. I'm glad I did it though. And I'm amused that I spent all this time trying to figure out if the auto-generated MongoDB \_id would work for my purposes, and in the very next Learn Node video, Wes Bos actually brings that up and shows you how to use it. Of course. P.S. Please enjoy Jiji's typings in this entry.

**Link to work**: [dang-thats-delicious repo](https://github.com/smwarsh/dang-thats-delicious)


### R2D23: Sat January 12, 2019

**Today's progress**: I finished watching "Creating an Editing Flow for Stores" and got to 3:04 taking notes on it.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 8m

**Thoughts**: Wow, this video is so helpful! It answers all the questions that I've been puzzling through for the last week. I love it.

**Link to work**: [dang-thats-delicious repo](https://github.com/smwarsh/dang-thats-delicious)


### R2D24: Mon January 14, 2019

**Today's progress**: I took notes up to 14:49 in "Creating an Editing Flow for Stores," and I added a missing semi colon to the code.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: Ugh, it takes me so long to take notes on these videos. I'm glad I caught that semi colon though. And I'm excited to apply this module to Thrift!

**Link to work**: [dang-thats-delicious repo](https://github.com/smwarsh/dang-thats-delicious)


### R2D25: Tue January 15, 2019

**Today's progress**: In the morning, I finished taking notes on "Creating an Editing Flow for Stores," and I thought about how I will need to adapt dang-thats-delicious as Thrift. I started going through "Flash Messages" for Thrift and got to 2:47. I got sidetracked because the price field wouldn't accept a decimal number. So I set up a RegEx in the input field thanks to [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46203928) on StackOverflow. Then, I tried to follow [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36667986) on StackOverflow to manage prices in Mongoose, but it's not working (yet).

**Time spent coding**: 1h 9m

**Thoughts**: I'm so tired tonight. It's all this going to the gym! We've lifted on 4 of the past 5 days!

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D26: Wed January 16, 2019

**Today's progress**: I finished doing "Flash Messages" for Thrift. I got Mongoose to handle prices by writing a setter that changes prices to an integer price in cents and a getter that changes it back to a price, as a String. I fixed the getter to be as accurate as possible by using the roundToPrice method that I wrote in the old version of Thrift.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 13m

**Thoughts**: I am proud of myself for figuring out the pricing compatibility in the program. I learned about how setters and getters work in Mongoose [here](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/2.7.x/docs/getters-setters.html). I figured out an error with using toFixed in my getter with [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14059220) on StackOverflow.

### R2D27: Thu January 17, 2019

**Today's progress**: I added a dropdown box to choose a category and radio buttons to choose if the group is expense or income, and both of these things also save to the database when you hit Save.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 18m

**Thoughts**: There are so many more things to do now, to fix and edit what I've worked on today and yesterday. The price setter isn't working perfectly (it rounded a number incorrectly), I want to make the dropdown box options dynamic so it shows only expense or income categories depending on which option is selected, I want to style the radio buttons more, and I want to change the default of the dropdown to not be a category. I'm sure there is more but I'm exhausted and can't think.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D28: Fri January 18, 2019

**Today's progress**: I fixed the incorrect rounding problem in the setter for price in the Transaction schema. I set a blank default option for the dropdown box of categories. I researched both these things thoroughly, and I enjoyed [this article](https://hackernoon.com/understanding-the-problem-javascript-maths-2119d85dad2a) on why decimal math doesn't always work like you'd expect it to in JavaScript.

**Time spent coding**: 58m

**Thoughts**: This week I have been so tired by the time I get to coding every night, and today was no exception. I did not want to code, even though I have been enjoying what I'm doing this week. I'm proud of myself for pushing through it and getting a couple small but important things done. I'm definitely proud of what I accomplished in my code today too. Also, I need to fix the form's UX, because when there is an error and the flash message appears, the entire form is wiped clean. I would like to keep what the user has already input to the form where it is, so the user doesn't have to put everything in again.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D29: Sat January 19, 2019

**Today's progress**: I made the dropdown box of categories dynamic based on whether the expense or income radio button is selected.

**Time spent coding**: 2h 7m

**Thoughts**: I am so, so proud of what I've done today. I'm practically bursting with it. I have even shown my mom what I've done. I started with [this YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/UliJeDbc4cw) on how to make a dropdown menu dynamic based on the selection in another dropdown. I used tips from [this StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/q/8838648) to adapt the first dropdown into radio buttons and have it still work (using onclick instead of onchange, mostly). Also, since the YouTube video is from 2012, I refactored the code when I was done to be a little bit more concise and to use forEach instead of a for loop. It's still not the best, but I changed everything I knew I could do without breaking it.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D30: Sun January 20, 2019

**Today's progress**: I styled the 'expense' and 'income' radio buttons. Then, I set the default selected button to be 'expense' because without a button selected, it isn't obvious that they are even buttons, and I set the default of the dropdown to be expense categories. The dropdown previously populated with onclick, so that doesn't work with a default selection, so I had to make this workaround.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 29m

**Thoughts**: It took me a long time (52m, to be exact) to figure out how to make the radio buttons fill the entire width of their parent element, the `ul`. [This](https://answers.laserfiche.com/questions/102230/radio-button-side-by-side-width) is the answer that ended up helping. Along the way, I figured out some useful things like how to make the actual radio button itself disappear (it wasn't part of the aesthetic I was going for). I hope my UX is good... I'm afraid it won't be obvious what the radio buttons are or whatever else. It might be better if the buttons were flush with the top and it looked like each one was a tab that you could switch between. I'll keep that in mind for when I'm feeling like doing some advanced tweaks.

### R2D31: Mon January 21, 2019

**Today's progress**: I did "Saving Lat and Lng for each store" and got about halfway through "Geocoding Data with Google Maps" but it's not working so I undid everything and I'll start that video over tomorrow.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 2m

**Thoughts**: I'm a little annoyed because I don't see why this isn't working.

**Link to work**: [dang-thats-delicious repo](https://github.com/smwarsh/dang-thats-delicious)


### R2D32: Tue January 22, 2019

**Today's progress**: I'm taking a half day today. I got to 5:49 in "Geocoding Data with Google Maps" and the same thing didn't happen like it should. I found out that the API maxed out for Google Maps and I have to set up my own. I got the answer from the Slack, and here is the link I got there: https://github.com/wesbos/learn-node#the-google-maps-api-key-isnt-working

**Time spent coding**: 33m

**Thoughts**: It's crazy that the answer to my problem was answered only a couple of hours ago in the Slack for the Learn Node course. I got lucky!

**Link to work**: [dang-thats-delicious repo](https://github.com/smwarsh/dang-thats-delicious)


### R2D33: Wed January 23, 2019

**Today's progress**: I asked in the Learn Node Slack about whether you have to pay for the Google Maps API, and got an answer immediately! I signed up for my own API key and finished "Geocoding Data with Google Maps." Then I did "Quick Data Visualization Tip" to finish off Module #5.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 3m

**Thoughts**: I want this to go faster. I want to finish my project. Should I take notes on this module? This course has 15 modules, and I'm still in module 5. This is no pace to be going at if I want to finish my project within a couple of months. The reason I'm taking this course is so I can get Thrift working and finished. I also want to have the Now That's Delicious project from this course under my belt, so I have to understand that too. I guess this is like when I'm reading two books at a time. It takes me a while but when I finish, I finish two in a short span of time. I feel like I should not be taking my sweet time on this like I am. I don't know what to do. Should I leave Now That's Delicious as it is and keep following the Learn Node course for Thrift only? I feel like the answer is yes...

**Link to work**: [dang-thats-delicious repo](https://github.com/smwarsh/dang-thats-delicious)


### R2D34: Thu January 24, 2019

**Today's progress**: I did "Querying our Database for Stores" with Thrift, then brainstormed and made a plan for displaying transactions.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 13m

**Thoughts**: I decided last night to move forward with Thrift and leave Now That's Delicious in the dust for now. The way Wes displays the stores is not at all how I want to display the transactions, so I spent at least half of my time today brainstorming how to display the data by category and in tables. I have an idea that might actually work, and I had to stop myself from starting it _right away_. I can't believe I'm not going to be able to work on it until Monday because of the Toronto trip. Ugh.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D35: Fri January 25, 2019

**Today's progress**: I went through some Learn Node videos in the car to see if I need any of them for Thrift.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 4m

**Thoughts**: I wish I understood all the technologies of this project better. I have no idea what parts are Express and which parts are Node, etc.


### R2D36: Sun January 27, 2019

**Today's progress**: I went through more Learn Node videos in the car to see if I need any of them for Thrift.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 5m

**Thoughts**: This is looking good so far. I wish I knew how much helpful advice for Thrift is going to be in the course, because I feel like Iâ€™m at a point where I can stop the videos and do all the logic for Thrift now. But I donâ€™t want to miss any important tidbits in the videos. I think I will alternate watching the videos and doing the coding.


### R2D37: Mon January 28, 2019

**Today's progress**: I fixed a typo in the drop down box in the form, I cleaned up the data in MongoDB, and I tried to change the set up with my form-helpers.js but it didnâ€™t work so I changed it back.

**Time spent coding**: 40m

**Thoughts**: I didnâ€™t get to start the stuff Iâ€™m really excited about yet, but Iâ€™m looking forward to doing that tomorrow!

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D38: Tue January 29, 2019

**Today's progress**: I watched "Custom MongoDB Aggregations" and "Multiple Query Promises with Async:Await" and started to implement what I've learned.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 11m

**Thoughts**: The rest of the module ended up being very helpful. However, I feel overwhelmed by all the new information. The $group aggregation is not working how I expected it to. I need to poke around more at https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/ and maybe Google to find out what I'm looking for.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D39: Wed January 30, 2019

**Today's progress**: I wrote a MongoDB aggregation and successfully got all the transactions to group by category.

**Time spent coding**: 59m

**Thoughts**: This is good, I feel like I'm on the right track.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D40: Thu January 31, 2019

**Today's progress**: I made a plan for how to display the transactions on the page underneath their category heading and wrote some pseudocode. I also did file setup and the preliminary code for displaying transactions.

**Time spent coding**: ~1h 0m (I didn't write it down)

**Thoughts**: I'm excited to figure this out.

### R2D41: Sat February 2, 2019

**Today's progress**: I struggled with TypeError: getCategories is not a function for the whole time.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 8m

**Thoughts**: I can't figure out this error, and it's annoying. I just want to use a function from another file like I did with the form-helpers.js file in \_transactionForm.pug.

### R2D42: Sun February 3, 2019

**Today's progress**: I gave up on the external file and tried to get the function to work within the pug file. Still no luck. For the second half, I watched "Creating User Accounts" from the Learn Node course in the car on the way to a Super Bowl party.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 13m

**Thoughts**: I don't know why this function isn't working, but I'm getting closer to understanding. I did a lot of Googling today. The video I watched today will be useful once I get to that part of my project.

### R2D43: Mon February 4, 2019

**Today's progress**: I figured it out! Early on in the hour, I figured out the reason why .map() was returning an array of undefined values, thanks to [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37072265). I just needed to delete the {}! Then, during the rest of the time, I figured out how to display everything to the page.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 9m

**Thoughts**: Awesome! I mean, it looks really messy and I think the code is messy too, but it feels really good to succeed after days of struggle.

### R2D44: Wed February 6, 2019

**Today's progress**: Yesterday I took a mental health day. Today, I set the program to display the dates and prices properly. I also put all the functions in display.js that I hope to eventually use, once I figure out the "is not a function" TypeError. I messaged some with Jared, and he is taking a look at this issue. I did a CodePen challenge that Jared sent me.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 16m

**Thoughts**: It is cool for the dates and prices to be displaying properly, but I wish these functions could be in a different file, not directly in the pug file. I mean, it works for now, but the code won't be this short forever. The CodePen challenge was a nice break from the project, and I'm glad Jared shared it with me. I didn't refactor it, but I should have. I think the code would be a lot less primitive if I did. But lunch was about to end, so I didn't have a lot of time.

### R2D45: Thu February 7, 2019

**Today's progress**: I wrote a draft of a function to handle printing category names. I started setting up the form so it fills itself with info the user has already entered (like when they hit submit but there is a validation error). Jared helped me a lot with finding out how to use external JavaScript in pug. We had a call and he taught me how to pull and merge and work with branches in Git in the command line, and we made some fixes to the code he changed.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 30m

**Thoughts**: Today was good and productive. I'm glad I accomplished the goal of displaying everything on the page. Now I'm just about back where I was in - what was it, November? October? - when I had to stop and go learn something new (Node.js, namely).

### R2D46: Tue February 12, 2019

**Today's progress**: I made an account on Trello and set up a couple of boards: Thrift, Website, 100 Days of Code, and Job Search. I populated them too, with the ideas from my "Ideas" sections of this file, which I then deleted. I watched 3 videos from Module #8 of Learn Node.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 6m

**Thoughts**: I'm excited to be using Trello. These videos aren't very applicable at the moment. I went to Quebec this past weekend, and I was set to code on the plane but I forgot that my earbuds only connect to my phone, not the aux port on my computer. So I wasn't able to code like I wanted to. However, I did have a productive conversation on Sunday with Zoe and Maddy about steps toward getting a job as a front end engineer, so I did do a bit of "coding" there.

### R2D47: Wed February 13, 2019

**Today's progress**: I finished watching Module #8 of Learn Node. I continued doing Module #4 videos with Thrift after a long hiatus. I forgot I already did "Querying our Database for Stores" so I did that, then I started "Creating an Editing Flow for Stores" and immediately ran into a problem with the way I've set up Thrift to display things. I needed to rewatch "Uploading and Resizing Images with Middleware" to figure out how to use uuid, then I added "id" to my Transaction Schema so I could have a unique ID on each transaction. Then I added an edit icon and link to each `tr` for displaying transactions.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 21m

**Thoughts**: I love Trello! I'm more motivated to code now, which I'm sure is temporary, but still. I got a lot done today and I felt organized doing it.

### R2D48: Thu February 14, 2019

**Today's progress**: I spent most of my time looking up and reading typical front end developer job interview questions. I bookmarked a lot of good sites.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 42m

**Thoughts**: I'm still unsure if this should count as a day of coding or not, but I don't have much of a choice. I think if I'm going to get this done, I have to work it in with my coding. Coming to work at the Sparta Library was a good idea.


### R2D49: Fri February 15, 2019

**Today's progress**: I cleaned out my database and added some new transactions. I started going through "Creating an Editing Flow for Stores" but didn't get very far because I'm having a lot of trouble. Mostly, with autofilling the date input. I can either get it to show today's date or the transaction's date (the latter not reliably). I found out that all my transactions had the same "unique" ID, so I had to use `npm outdated` to check for the current version of uuid, then manually type that into package.json, then `npm update uuid`, then change the code from `uuid.v4()` to `uuidv4()` and change the `require` statement. Now I think the IDs are working, but the date still isn't. For some reason, when I edit something, the date is stuck on 2/15 (even though at this point it was 2/16 and the transactions I was looking at were from other days)...

**Time spent coding**: 1h 36m

**Thoughts**: I am exhausted but still got sucked into the problem solving of this troubleshooting. I hope to figure it out soon.

### R2D50: Sat February 16, 2019

**Today's progress**: I scrapped the uuid idea and figured out how to use the automatically generated ID from MongoDB. I tried to figure out the date problem and found this helpful page: https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/489. I also redid my database entries.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 2m

**Thoughts**: Ooh I'm so mad about this date problem. Basically, it's in the database correctly, but when I format it to display it on the website in any way, it puts the date into GMT from ET, effectively making every date show up as the day before itself. Ugh! I'm too tired tonight to figure this out, so I'll try looking at it again tomorrow.

### R2D51: Sun February 17, 2019

**Today's progress**: I tried again on the date problem and I _just can't get it_. I messaged Jared, then moved on to other stuff. I made sure the edit form auto-fills correctly (except for the date, grr), which took a bit of work, then I set it up so the form submission actually updates the transaction in the database. I finished Module #4 of Learn Node!

**Time spent coding**: 1h 21m

**Thoughts**: Hopefully Jared will have a breakthrough on the date thing, because I am struggling with it.

### R2D52: Mon February 18, 2019

**Today's progress**: I fixed the date problem! I tried presave and setters in the model but I ended up using a solution from the helpful thread. I had to adapt it a lot though.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 22m

**Thoughts**: I'm surprised and impressed with myself, that I figured this out after days of struggle, and it is the solution I was trying on my own too, not Jared's!

### R2D53: Tue February 19, 2019

**Today's progress**: I went to the library to work on The Job Hunt. I messaged a classmate from UR about job openings at their company, I sent a connection request with a note to a UR alumna working at a cool branding company, I updated my LinkedIn profile, and I started creating my old resume in InDesign (I couldn't find the old editable file).

**Time spent coding**: 2h 10m

**Thoughts**: There is so much to do. I wish I had my old resume file so I didn't have to start the layout from scratch. There is so much to change with the content too. I'm excited about my updated LinkedIn profile though. It's much better for my job search now, while still not screaming, "I'm trying to leave my job!"

### R2D54: Wed February 20, 2019

**Today's progress**: I wrote a function to sort all the transactions by date within the category (which I actually easily adapted from the old version of Thrift, which I printed out for better perusal). I wrote and implemented a function to label the categories as "Expense" or "Income" but to only print out that heading before the first category in each group.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 22m

**Thoughts**: I feel good about today's progress! Also, I got a bunch of messages on LinkedIn that I need to follow up on

### R2D55: Thu February 21, 2019

**Today's progress**: I got my resume to an acceptable state, then responded to everyone who messaged me on LinkedIn.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 40m

**Thoughts**: I am totally unqualified for these jobs, but I bet if I were a man, I would barge ahead. So that's what I will do. I couldn't help myself from talking myself down a little in my email to Kyle Ryan, which I now regret. Hopefully it doesn't affect his reaction. I'm learning.

**Tomorrow**: Watch Module #9 in Learn Node while on the road
