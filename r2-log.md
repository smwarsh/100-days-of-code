### R2D2: Sun December 16, 2018

**Today's progress**: I took notes on "Saving Stores and Using Mixins" and got to 5:30 in "Using Async Await" in the Learn Node course.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 1m

**Thoughts**: R2-D2! Beep boop. Today was kind of boring.

### R2D3: Mon December 17, 2018

**Today's progress**: I finished "Using Async Await" in the Learn Node course and got to 5:30 taking notes. I finished my coding notebook and found a new notebook to use.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: Trying to think of how I will implement all this in Thrift. I might have to take the starter files and adapt them to Thrift.

### R2D4: Tue December 18, 2018

**Today's progress**: I took notes up to 13:59 in "Using Async Await."

**Time spent coding**: 1h 3m

**Thoughts**: There is a lot to process in this video.

### R2D5: Wed December 19, 2018

**Today's progress**: I finished taking notes on "Using Async Await," watched/did "Flash Messages," and got to 3:44 taking notes on the same.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 4m

**Thoughts**: Woo flashes. Still not the most exciting course.

### R2D6: Fri December 21, 2018

**Today's progress**: I finished taking notes on "Flash Messages" and messaged Alex M about helping him with his website's design.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 5m

**Thoughts**: I hope Alex responds! I wonder if I should be working on Thrift along with this Node.js course, because I feel like I will need to redo the whole course when I want to adapt Thrift to this.

### R2D7: Sat December 22, 2018

**Today's progress**: I started "Querying our Database for Stores" then got a bunch of errors and reverted everything to the way it was before today. The errors are still there...

**Time spent coding**: 1h 12m

**Thoughts**: I'm pissed. I did nothing wrong; this started happening randomly. Clearing the cache in Chrome didn't work like it did for me last time. I don't know what to do.


### R2D8: Sun December 23, 2018

**Today's progress**: I very carefully went through "Querying our Database for Stores" and it all worked out today!

**Time spent coding**: 52m

**Thoughts**: I guess my computer needed some time to sleep on it.

### R2D9: Wed December 26, 2018

**Today's progress**: I took notes on "Querying our Database for Stores." I also thought a lot about incorporating Node.js into Thrift.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 4m

**Thoughts**: I had a couple busy days with the holidays and didn't get to code on Christmas Eve or Christmas! But I'm back today, and I have a lot of questions about how I can start working on Thrift with all this Node.js stuff. I don't want to have to redo the entire course once I start working on Thrift, so maybe I can do it concurrently.


### R2D10: Thu December 27, 2018

**Today's progress**: I did research on how to start Thrift with the Learn Node starter files. I messaged Jared asking for guidance. I restarted the course for Thrift. I'm currently @ 4:04 in the "Setting Up MongoDB" video, just getting as far as I can to develop educated questions for Jared when I talk to him tomorrow. I scanned localhost and stephwarsh.com for open ports and took a screenshot of the results for localhost. The scan on stephwarsh.com went for 15 min without returning anything or finishing so I gave up. I don't know if there are any open ports on there anyway.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 22m

**Thoughts**: I did a bunch of different stuff today, prepping for getting Thrift going again. There's a lot I need to clear up.

### R2D11: Fri December 28, 2018

**Today's progress**: I set up for my call with Jared and put some questions together, then I talked to him and got some questions answered!

**Time spent coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: I learned a lot from my call with Jared! One of those things is that I will definitely break things, as hard as I try not to, but it will make me a better programmer in the end. Also, there is specific software for deploying an app once it is completed. You don't just pop it in the FTP client like I thought you would. And, I learned that knowing Git is something I should do.

**Link to work**: [Thrift repo](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D12: Sat December 29, 2018

**Today's progress**: I researched, looking for good courses to learn Git quickly. I got to 1:27 in Lecture 7, "Pushing Your First Commit to GitHub," in this Udemy course, [Short and Sweet: Get Started with Git and GitHub Right Now](https://www.udemy.com/short-and-sweet-get-started-with-git-and-github-right-now/learn/v4/content), which I found from this article, "[Top 5 Free Courses to Learn Git and Github](https://hackernoon.com/top-5-free-courses-to-learn-git-and-github-best-of-lot-2f394c6533b0)."

**Time spent coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: I am learning surprisingly a lot from this course, and I think I will like the extra control I will get using the Terminal over GitHub Desktop.


### R2D13: Sun December 30, 2018

**Today's progress**: I finished the Git course, then I followed a link to an article, "[How you can learn Git and GitHub while youâ€™re learning to code](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-you-can-learn-git-and-github-while-youre-learning-to-code-7a592ea287ba)," that someone gave me on Twitter. I went through that, and I did the whole process of setting up an SSH key before finding out that it is already set up on my account. 7687 (That's from Jiji). I am now working through the "Clone your repositories" section.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 14m

**Thoughts**: There is a lot to do here, but I think I am learning it quickly. I feel guilty for not having a license on my repositories. I feel like I should at least look up the MIT license.

**Link to work**: [New Thrift repo](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D14: Tue January 1, 2019

**Today's progress**: I think I finished setting up the Thrift repository via the command line? I changed the username and password for Thrift in MongoDB

**Time spent coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: There were a lot of complications on the command line. Even though I deleted Thrift from GitHub, when I added it to GitHub again via the command line, it still had all my old commits there, including the files I newly put in .gitignore. So I had to delete the variables.env file with help from [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18393498/gitignore-all-the-ds-store-files-in-every-folder-and-subfolder), but the commit was still in my commit history, showing the database connection info and everything else for all to see. So I used [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/495345/how-to-remove-selected-commit-log-entries-from-a-git-repository-while-keeping-th) and [this article](http://web.archive.org/web/20100213104931/http://blog.madism.org/index.php/2007/09/09/138-git-awsome-ness-git-rebase-interactive) to try to delete it, but it didn't work. I got errors. So I gave up and changed the MongoDB username and password, so hopefully no one will be able to hack my project. Then, it turns out that the variables.env file got actually deleted from my local files, so I had to create it again and copy in the code from the deleted file. The good news is that now variables.env is on my computer but not showing up on GitHub! So I think I finally have that working. I'm starting to question that I ever deleted the Thrift respository like I thought I did. Why would everything still be there? I got a weird error when trying to connect my local Thrift repository to my remote repository on GitHub and used [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10904339/github-fatal-remote-origin-already-exists) to override the connection that was apparently already there.

### R2D15: Wed January 2, 2019

**Today's progress**: I redid the whole Thrift repository thing (I deleted the repository, recreated it, and reinitialized it), then I posted a blog post about how to do this thing I've gone through 3+ times in Git. I also looked up GitHub licenses and decided "no license" is the one for me, for now.

**Time spent coding**: 2h 2m

**Thoughts**: Today was genuinely very enjoyable. I saw the opportunity for a blog post and I went for it. I didn't want to spend too much time on the styling, so I was pleased when the code snippets came out looking exactly like I wanted them to, first try. And now everything with the Thrift repository is fixed and reset, although sadly it deleted all the pretty green squares on my profile that have been tracking my GitHub activity for the past week or so.

### R2D16: Thu January 3, 2019

**Today's progress**: I changed moment to date-fns in the starter files I am using for Thrift. I finished the "Introduction and Setup" chapter of the Learn Node course for Thrift. I created the impressively large amount of node modules by running `npm install`. I spent the rest of the time fixing security vulnerabilities.

**Time spent coding**: 2h 20m

**Thoughts**: I truly went down the rabbit hole today. Wow. I hope I didn't break ~~everything~~ anything. I was especially nervous about the "breaking change" for fixing the security vulnerability in deep-extend (dependency of juice). But at the end of it all, it seems to be working?

**Link to work**: [Thrift repo (6 big commits today!)](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D17: Fri January 4, 2019

**Today's progress**: I got almost all the way through Module #2 Core Concepts in the Learn Node course today, working on Thrift this time. The next video (and last one in the module) is "Middleware and Error Handling." I mostly followed the videos but I adapted for how I want to use them and what I want to call them in Thrift.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 6m

**Thoughts**: I thought a bit about how I want Thrift to look in the end and what similarities & differences it will have from Dang That's Delicious, the Learn Node project. I wonder if I will add transactions on the page or have them added through a separate page? I would prefer the former but I have only learned how to do the latter. It's good that I've already done this part of the course, because it is easy to see what parts are applicable to Thrift and what parts I can skim through.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D18: Sat January 5, 2019

**Today's progress**: I watched/did "Creating our Store Model," following along for Thrift. I implemented the database schema for transactions, but I am hung up on the ID and how to make it auto increment in MongoDB, because it's not built in like it is in SQL.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 8m

**Thoughts**: I am not done noodling about the auto-increment ID, so here is a list of articles I have open that I want to continue looking at:
* [Stack Overflow: "Mongoose auto increment"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28357965/mongoose-auto-increment)
* [Hashnode: "What is the best way to generate auto incrementing ID in MongoDB?"](https://hashnode.com/post/what-is-the-best-way-to-generate-auto-incrementing-id-in-mongodb-ciibz8ege00l6j3xtx7c2kubm)
* [Tutorials Point: "MongoDB - Auto-Increment Sequence"](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb/mongodb_autoincrement_sequence.htm)
* [NPM mongodb-autoincrement - _I don't think this is what I'm looking for_](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-autoincrement)

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D19: Sun January 6, 2019

**Today's progress**: I looked through the articles for auto increment in MongoDB, then I did "Saving Stores and Using Mixins," following along for Thrift.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 3m

**Thoughts**: I moved on from looking at the articles because I can't test anything until I have more set up and can see if auto-incrementing actually works. So I kept following the videos and getting things set up for that.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D20: Mon January 7, 2019

**Today's progress**: I followed the "Using Async Await" video from the Learn Node course and set up Thrift to add things to the database. Then, I tested it and did some research on the ID situation.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 18m

**Thoughts**: I think I might not have to figure out auto-increment for the ID in MongoDB. I have an idea, and it involves using the auto-generated unique \_id field that every database item seems to have. I need to do some more investigation. Helpful pages that I have open:
* [StackOverflow: how do I search for an object by its ObjectId in the console?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8233014/how-do-i-search-for-an-object-by-its-objectid-in-the-console)
* [MongoDB: db.collection.find()](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.find/)
* [MongoDB: ObjectId](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/)

### R2D21: Tue January 8, 2019

**Today's progress**: I fought sleep and watched some videos from the Practical JavaScript course to figure out how to use the id of an item to edit/delete it.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 1m

**Thoughts**: I coded early today, after dropping Caitlin off at school! I didn't get much done because of my tiredness. It seems like I may have to wait until there is a page with a list of all the transactions on it before I start figuring out the delete capability. And maybe Wes Bos will even show me how to do it! Although I doubt he will show exactly what I'm looking for, he will probably give some helpful general information on the topic of deleting from MongoDB.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D22: Fri January 11, 2019

**Today's progress**: I watched Practical JavaScript Version 10 "Clicking delete should update todoList.todos and the DOM" and then started watching Learn Node\]]\\\\\\\ "Creating an Editing Flow for Stores" and got to 7:50. In between the two videos, I moved dang-thats-delicious from GitHub Desktop to using Git instead.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 0m]\\

**Thoughts**: I missed 2 days in a row and almost skipped today too. I'm tired and it's late. I'm glad I did it though. And I'm amused that I spent all this time trying to figure out if the auto-generated MongoDB \_id would work for my purposes, and in the very next Learn Node video, Wes Bos actually brings that up and shows you how to use it. Of course. P.S. Please enjoy Jiji's typings in this entry.

### R2D23: Sat January 12, 2019

**Today's progress**: I finished watching "Creating an Editing Flow for Stores" and got to 3:04 taking notes on it.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 8m

**Thoughts**: Wow, this video is so helpful! It answers all the questions that I've been puzzling through for the last week. I love it.

**Link to work**: [dang-thats-delicious repo](https://github.com/smwarsh/dang-thats-delicious)


### R2D24: Mon January 14, 2019

**Today's progress**: I took notes up to 14:49 in "Creating an Editing Flow for Stores," and I added a missing semi colon to the code.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: Ugh, it takes me so long to take notes on these videos. I'm glad I caught that semi colon though. And I'm excited to apply this module to Thrift!

**Link to work**: [dang-thats-delicious repo](https://github.com/smwarsh/dang-thats-delicious)


### R2D25: Tue January 15, 2019

**Today's progress**: In the morning, I finished taking notes on "Creating an Editing Flow for Stores," and I thought about how I will need to adapt dang-thats-delicious as Thrift. I started going through "Flash Messages" for Thrift and got to 2:47. I got sidetracked because the price field wouldn't accept a decimal number. So I set up a RegEx in the input field thanks to [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46203928) on StackOverflow. Then, I tried to follow [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36667986) on StackOverflow to manage prices in Mongoose, but it's not working (yet).

**Time spent coding**: 1h 9m

**Thoughts**: I'm so tired tonight. It's all this going to the gym! We've lifted on 4 of the past 5 days!

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)


### R2D26: Wed January 16, 2019

**Today's progress**: I finished doing "Flash Messages" for Thrift. I got Mongoose to handle prices by writing a setter that changes prices to an integer price in cents and a getter that changes it back to a price, as a String. I fixed the getter to be as accurate as possible by using the roundToPrice method that I wrote in the old version of Thrift.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 13m

**Thoughts**: I am proud of myself for figuring out the pricing compatibility in the program. I learned about how setters and getters work in Mongoose [here](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/2.7.x/docs/getters-setters.html). I figured out an error with using toFixed in my getter with [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14059220) on StackOverflow.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/thrift)

**Tomorrow**: Put dropdown box of categories and radio buttons for expense/income choice in \_transactionForm.pug.

**Ideas**: Change website to use a WordPress CMS. Implement Web Mentions once I get my website on a WordPress CMS. Learn about service workers, and implement them. Do a 3-5 hour personal code-a-thon once in every 30 days (Eric's idea). Sign into the Women Who Code Slack workspace. Do the Terminal tutorial that Jared sent me. Implement DRY for isolateGroupByRange functionality, somehow... Learn CSS Grid. Fix nav bar on home page of website. Fix Warner page. Add top & bottom margin to code snippets on blog page.
