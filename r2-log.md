# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Round 2

### R2D1: Fri December 14, 2018

**Today's progress**: I watched/did the "Saving Stores and Using Mixins" video from the Learn Node course.

**Time spent coding**: 55m

**Thoughts**: Where will this 100 days take me?

### R2D2: Sun December 16, 2018

**Today's progress**: I took notes on "Saving Stores and Using Mixins" and got to 5:30 in "Using Async Await" in the Learn Node course.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 1m

**Thoughts**: R2-D2! Beep boop. Today was kind of boring.

### R2D3: Mon December 17, 2018

**Today's progress**: I finished "Using Async Await" in the Learn Node course and got to 5:30 taking notes. I finished my coding notebook and found a new notebook to use.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: Trying to think of how I will implement all this in Thrift. I might have to take the starter files and adapt them to Thrift.

### R2D4: Tue December 18, 2018

**Today's progress**: I took notes up to 13:59 in "Using Async Await."

**Time spent coding**: 1h 3m

**Thoughts**: There is a lot to process in this video.

### R2D5: Wed December 19, 2018

**Today's progress**: I finished taking notes on "Using Async Await," watched/did "Flash Messages," and got to 3:44 taking notes on the same.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 4m

**Thoughts**: Woo flashes. Still not the most exciting course.

### R2D6: Fri December 21, 2018

**Today's progress**: I finished taking notes on "Flash Messages" and messaged Alex M about helping him with his website's design.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 5m

**Thoughts**: I hope Alex responds! I wonder if I should be working on Thrift along with this Node.js course, because I feel like I will need to redo the whole course when I want to adapt Thrift to this.

### R2D7: Sat December 22, 2018

**Today's progress**: I started "Querying our Database for Stores" then got a bunch of errors and reverted everything to the way it was before today. The errors are still there...

**Time spent coding**: 1h 12m

**Thoughts**: I'm pissed. I did nothing wrong; this started happening randomly. Clearing the cache in Chrome didn't work like it did for me last time. I don't know what to do.


### R2D8: Sun December 23, 2018

**Today's progress**: I very carefully went through "Querying our Database for Stores" and it all worked out today!

**Time spent coding**: 52m

**Thoughts**: I guess my computer needed some time to sleep on it.

### R2D9: Wed December 26, 2018

**Today's progress**: I took notes on "Querying our Database for Stores." I also thought a lot about incorporating Node.js into Thrift.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 4m

**Thoughts**: I had a couple busy days with the holidays and didn't get to code on Christmas Eve or Christmas! But I'm back today, and I have a lot of questions about how I can start working on Thrift with all this Node.js stuff. I don't want to have to redo the entire course once I start working on Thrift, so maybe I can do it concurrently.

**Link to work**: None today.

**Tomorrow**: Research the things in my notebook; ask Jared some questions.

**Ideas**: Change website to use a WordPress CMS. Implement Web Mentions once I get my website on a WordPress CMS. Learn about service workers, and implement them. Do a 3-5 hour personal code-a-thon once in every 30 days (Eric's idea). Sign into the Women Who Code Slack workspace. Do the Terminal tutorial that Jared sent me. Implement DRY for isolateGroupByRange functionality, somehow... Learn CSS Grid. Fix nav bar on home page of website. Fix Warner page.
