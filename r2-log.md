# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Round 2

### R2D1: Friday December 14, 2018

**Today's progress**: I watched/did the "Saving Stores and Using Mixins" video from the Learn Node course.

**Time spent coding**: 55m

**Thoughts**: Where will this 100 days take me?

### R2D2: Sunday December 16, 2018

**Today's progress**: I took notes on "Saving Stores and Using Mixins" and got to 5:30 in "Using Async Await" in the Learn Node course.

**Time spent coding**: 1h 1m

**Thoughts**: R2-D2! Beep boop. Today was kind of boring.

**Tomorrow**: Finish "Using Async Await" and start taking notes - and find a new coding notebook!

**Ideas**: Change website to use a WordPress CMS. Implement Web Mentions once I get my website on a WordPress CMS. Learn about service workers, and implement them. Do a 3-5 hour personal code-a-thon once in every 30 days (Eric's idea). Sign into the Women Who Code Slack workspace. Do the Terminal tutorial that Jared sent me. Implement DRY for isolateGroupByRange functionality, somehow... Learn CSS Grid. Fix home page of website. Fix Warner page!
