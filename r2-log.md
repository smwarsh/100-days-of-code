**Today's progress**: I finished taking notes on "Using Async Await," watched/did "Flash Messages," and got to 3:44 taking notes on the same.

**Tomorrow**: Finish taking notes on "Flash Messages."

**Ideas**: Change website to use a WordPress CMS. Implement Web Mentions once I get my website on a WordPress CMS. Learn about service workers, and implement them. Do a 3-5 hour personal code-a-thon once in every 30 days (Eric's idea). Sign into the Women Who Code Slack workspace. Do the Terminal tutorial that Jared sent me. Implement DRY for isolateGroupByRange functionality, somehow... Learn CSS Grid. Fix nav bar on home page of website. Fix Warner page.
