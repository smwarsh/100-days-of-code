# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Refamiliarized myself with GitHub, changed username to smwarsh so it will be consistent across platforms, refamiliarized myself with basic terminal commands, updated my website for the first time since August 2017! Made new "Blog" page on my website with a post about my expectations and goals for this challenge.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 32m

**Thoughts:** I'm frustrated. I made a new page for my website because I just want a simple dumb text page to put this blog post on (I'll make it pretty later). It looks silly with only the basic formatting that I already have in my CSS for my site, so I added some new classes and called them in CSS, etc. But for some reason, although the CSS pretends to be updated, it's not. I even put the new CSS file online because I thought it might be a MAMP issue, but there is no sign of any edits when I look at the page source. But when I download the file from Cyberduck, the edits ARE in the file! I'm baffled! I'm usually very good at figuring out these types of problems, after being a lab TA for an intro to web design class for so long, but I'm stumped. Maybe it's just taking awhile to sync? I can't figure it out.

### Day 2: August 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for FreeCodeCamp and started Basic JavaScript curriculum. Did 36 challenges. Also took the new coders survey and uploaded my challenges to GitHub.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 10m

**Thoughts**: I can't believe I didn't do this a year ago. It's so easy to just sit down and code. Today was all review and quite easy, but I feel like this time I will get past the JavaScript basics, so hopefully this is my last time "learning" them.

**Tomorrow**: Fix up website a little bit. Add hyperlinks to blog post. Continue Basic JavaScript curriculum on FreeCodeCamp.


### Day 3: August 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I updated some small things on my website so it doesn't say I'm a student in Rochester anymore! I fixed up the blog page quite a bit: added hyperlinks, tested and fixed them, styled the page, looked up a bunch of CSS stuff as a refresher while doing this. In the last bit of the hour I did 14 Basic JavaScript challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 5m

**Thoughts**: My suspicions were correct! It was the cache all along that was keeping me from seeing my updates to the CSS on my website. Evil cache! I'm glad I figured that out and was able to update my site. Doing work on my website is far more fun and engaging than doing the exercises on FreeCodeCamp in JavaScript, but I know I have to keep plugging away at the JavaScript if I want to become a competitive job candidate for a web dev job.
