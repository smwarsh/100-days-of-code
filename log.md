# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I refamiliarized myself with GitHub, changed my username to smwarsh so it will be consistent across platforms, refamiliarized myself with basic terminal commands, updated my website for the first time since August 2017! I made a new "Blog" page on my website with a post about my expectations and goals for this challenge.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 32m

**Thoughts**: I'm frustrated. I made a new page for my website because I just want a simple dumb text page to put this blog post on (I'll make it pretty later). It looks silly with only the basic formatting that I already have in my CSS for my site, so I added some new classes and called them in CSS, etc. But for some reason, although the CSS pretends to be updated, it's not. I even put the new CSS file online because I thought it might be a MAMP issue, but there is no sign of any edits when I look at the page source. But when I download the file from Cyberduck, the edits ARE in the file! I'm baffled! I'm usually very good at figuring out these types of problems, after being a lab TA for an intro to web design class for so long, but I'm stumped. Maybe it's just taking awhile to sync? I can't figure it out.

### Day 2: August 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I signed up for FreeCodeCamp and started Basic JavaScript curriculum. I did 36 challenges. I also took the new coders survey and uploaded my challenges to GitHub.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 10m

**Thoughts**: I can't believe I didn't do this a year ago. It's so easy to just sit down and code. Today was all review and quite easy, but I feel like this time I will get past the JavaScript basics, so hopefully this is my last time "learning" them.

### Day 3: August 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I updated some small things on my website so it doesn't say I'm a student in Rochester anymore! I fixed up the blog page quite a bit: added hyperlinks, tested and fixed them, styled the page, looked up a bunch of CSS stuff as a refresher while doing this. In the last bit of the hour I did 14 Basic JavaScript challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 5m

**Thoughts**: My suspicions were correct! It was the cache all along that was keeping me from seeing my updates to the CSS on my website. Evil cache! I'm glad I figured that out and was able to update my site. Doing work on my website is far more fun and engaging than doing the exercises on FreeCodeCamp in JavaScript, but I know I have to keep plugging away at the JavaScript if I want to become a competitive job candidate for a web dev job.

### Day 4: August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Basic JavaScript course in FreeCodeCamp for half an hour. Then I started and completed the Basic HTML course under the Responsive Web Design Certification in FreeCodeCamp for the rest of the time.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 7m

**Thoughts**: I feel like there is so much to do, and only coding for an hour a day won't be fast enough! But doing just a little bit every day is still getting something done, and I am proud of that. The JS course is still all review, although there was one challenging task where I had to remember the pop and shift functions from last time. I was pleased when I got it right! The HTML course was, of course, review, but I was surprised how much I got from it. I learned a couple small new things, learned some best practices, and got a good review of forms. I wish the info on forms was more comprehensive. It doesn't give you the information to actually send form submissions to an email or website and receive them there, which is a problem if you actually want to make a form yourself.

**Tomorrow**: Continue Basic JavaScript curriculum on FreeCodeCamp, start Basic CSS curriculum, create a contact form on my website (How do you make the form send data to yourself? Look this up)

**Ideas**: Implement Web Mentions once I get my website on a WordPress CMS. Create a contact form on my website.



### Day 5: August 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Basic JavaScript course in FreeCodeCamp for half an hour. For the rest of the time, I worked on a contact form for my website. I wanted to start the Basic CSS curriculum too, but I need to keep this to two projects at a time. Oops, started that later in the afternoon. Forgot about the 2 project rule and got too excited!

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 22m

**Thoughts**: The JavaScript challenges required a little more independent thinking and coding today, which was nice. Everything is still review, but I don't resent the review. I'd be lost without it. There is so much to consider for a contact form for my website. For one thing, I need to figure out how to make the textarea box responsive to page size. When I tested it on a smaller page width, it broke the boundaries of the container. So, I just left it very small for now. This is definitely something I have to look into.

### Day 6: August 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Basic JavaScript course in FreeCodeCamp for 15 minutes in the morning, then another 15 minutes at lunch. For the rest of lunch, I worked on the contact form. I tried to make the PHP form processor using an old lab from college, but it didn't work (I didn't expect it to). So I started [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q0gYjAVonI) and got to 4:09.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 3m

**Thoughts**: The JavaScript is new now! This is good, but I feel like FreeCodeCamp isn't teaching me very well, like I couldn't practically use these aspects of JavaScript on my own. I wish there were a small assignment, like a lab assignment, where I could practice the things I've learned so far. There is a lot to do for the contact form. I know a contact form will be a readily available plugin once I move my site over to a WordPress CMS, but I think it's a good exercise to build one from scratch. Hopefully the video I'm watching will help me get it working.

### Day 7: August 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Basic JavaScript curriculum on FreeCodeCamp for half an hour, then spent the rest of the time rewriting the PHP form processor for my contact form and debugging it.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 48m

**Thoughts**: Today was much more challenging than previous days. For one thing, the JavaScript required a lot of careful thinking, and I'm going a lot more slowly now that the material is new. One good thing - I got a recommendation from someone on Twitter for another JavaScript learning curriculum with projects that I can try. I want to practically apply the stuff I'm learning and I don't know how, so this might help. For the contact form, I'm having a lot of trouble with it and it's frustrating. For much of the time I struggled with an Error 500, and I honestly don't even know how I fixed it. But I'm relieved it's fixed and I'm on to a more common problem: The form appears to be working but I'm not receiving the email. I'll check my inbox again tomorrow... I hope it's just taking awhile to go through, because I'm not looking forward to continuing the debugging process.

### Day 8: August 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Basic JavaScript curriculum on FreeCodeCamp for 45 minutes, then spent the rest of the time debugging my contact form code. I scrapped everything, started it from scratch, and now it works!

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 48m

**Thoughts**: I got stuck on something in the Basic JavaScript course so I was working on it for over 30 minutes, but I reached challenge 100! It feels good to be challenged by this new material. As for the contact form, I can't even describe how relieved I felt when that first message came through to my email after rewriting the entire code from scratch. I don't know what was wrong with it before, but I'm so happy I finally figured it out.

**Links to work**:

2. [Contact Form on my Website](http://stephwarsh.com/contact.php)

**Tomorrow**: Continue Basic JavaScript curriculum on FreeCodeCamp. Start making the contact form yours, slowly and carefully, testing it frequently to make sure it still works.

**Ideas**: Change website to use a WordPress CMS. Implement Web Mentions once I get my website on a WordPress CMS. Look up how to make the textarea in my contact form responsive to page widths (use CSS?). Start [Gordon Zhu's Practical JavaScript course](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) after finishing the FreeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript curriculum. Put website files onto GitHub repository and work in the files on GitHub Desktop? Look up how to do this! Learn about service workers, and implement them.


### Day 9: August 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Basic JavaScript curriculum on FreeCodeCamp! Then I started Gordon Zhu's Practical JavaScript course. After that, I worked on improving the style of my contact form.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 16m

**Thoughts**: I'm happy I finished the Basic JavaScript course, and the Practical JavaScript course looks promising. I'm looking forward to working on an actual project and applying my knowledge of JavaScript. I'm still having issues with my site not updating as I work on it, so I've been having to use my phone browser to make sure the changes are actually being implement and to test that the contact form is still working (it is). That's annoying, but it's still fun to work with CSS.

### Day 10: August 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I continued Gordon Zhu's Practical JavaScript course and completed version 1 of the app, using the console in the browser. Then, I styled my contact form and watched [a video](https://youtu.be/E5MEzC0prd4), which I hoped would tell me how to do error handling but has not so far. I got to 25:50.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 1m

**Thoughts**: My site not updating when I'm editing it is getting really bothersome. I basically have to code blind and hope it's working. I wish I knew how to make it work consistently. Other thoughts: this is probably the hardest time I've had doing this so far. I am so tired I kept nearly falling asleep and I was afraid I wouldn't be able to finish the hour

### Day 11: August 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did V2 of the todo list in the Practical JavaScript course, working in the console. Then I watched some videos, like , starting to figure out how to do error handling on my PHP contact form.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 12m

**Thoughts**: I'm getting a little bored of these projects. None of the JavaScript is new to me, and it seems odd to be coding in the browser console. It doesn't save my code, obviously, so when I ran out of time at lunch and picked up again after work, all that code was lost and I didn't feel like rewriting to continue following along. I also have less of a clear path forward with my form. It works now, so should I focus on perfecting the CSS? Implementing error handling? Security? Is that last one even a thing? I need more of a purpose in these two projects.

### Day 12: August 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I looked into PHP form error handling without using an include, then decided to just be done with and move on from the contact form project. I spent the rest of the hour working on the Practical JavaScript course. I wanted to put the code I wrote on GitHub, so I spent half an hour figuring out how to do that and refamiliarizing myself with GitHub Desktop.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 33m

**Thoughts**: I coded for a lot longer than I expected! It was really hard to get started today. I was feeling depressed, which is the first time I've experienced that obstacle in 100 Days of Code, but I know it won't be the last. I managed 40m of coding before taking a break. I was feeling much better by the time I returned to it later. I coded each of the todo list functions and methods before watching the video tutorial, and I was really pleased to get them all right for the most part! (They were correct in the important ways.) So I was in a good mood by the time I finished the hour. The rest of the time, I relearned how to use GitHub Desktop and I put today's work on GitHub. I feel good!

### Day 13: August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did Watch and Code todo list project version 4.

**Time Spent Coding**: 56m

**Thoughts**: I'm exhausted. I hope I'm not burning myself out, but this coding is one of the main things that makes me feel a sense of purpose in my life now. So, I'm proud I coded tonight. My eyelids kept closing but luckily several of the topics (for loops, for example) were review so I think I'll be fine. I did well attempting to write the code before he showed us how, although not quite as well as yesterday, which is good because it means the course is challenging me more now.

### Day 14: August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did Watch and Code todo list project version 5 and started version 6.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 10m

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I don't feel as sick today (I took yesterday off because I was so spent), but I'm definitely tired and wasn't on the ball with knowing the answers ahead of time like I usually do. Hopefully another good night's sleep tonight will get me on a better track for tomorrow.

### Day 15: August 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished Watch and Code todo list version 6 and spent a lot of time in the "Data Types and Comparisons" interlude (I finished that too).

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 12m

**Thoughts**: The "Data Types and Comparisons" was hard! I got a couple of the examples wrong, even though I wrote out the diagram like he said to do. At least I think I understand it all, even though I got it wrong at first. It's nice to know how to code in JavaScript, but I'm starting to think about how it would be nice to learn how to use it in real life, like on my website for example. I have no idea how to connect it to HTML or CSS or anything else. We're 100% using the console currently.

### Day 16: August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I decided to create a budget tracker web app! Yesterday, off the clock, I wrote a rough draft of the requirements for the app. Today, I made the requirements more detailed and specific, and I started going through them and thinking about what each requirement actually entailed. I also marked out which requirements I think are necessary to create the minimum viable product (MVP) version of the app.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 9m

**Thoughts**: I didn't actually do any coding today, but this may be even more valuable than all the previous days where I was following tutorials and coding within that structure. Today, I started my first JavaScript project! My budget tracker app. I have experienced a lot of conflict over the last day or two since Zoe provided the inspiration for this project idea (she mentioned doing something about finance, because I'm interested in that topic, and I had the idea to recreate my current Excel spreadsheet in a more convenient and user friendly form). I've been thinking about it constantly. This is a huge project, and I'm nervous I won't be able to finish it within the timeline we set (3 months). But I'm going to do my best. Hopefully what I worked on today will provide a solid foundation for the project's success.

### Day 17: August 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I elaborated on a few more requirements for my budget tracker app in my notebook at lunch. After work, I did version 7 of the Watch and Code todo list app. I also started reading the first book in the You Don't Know JS book series by Kyle Simpson, Up & Going, but I didn't include this in the time spent coding. I'm still in the first chapter.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 21m

**Thoughts**: I wish I could have been more focused on my requirements for the budget tracker app. I worked on it for almost half an hour and only added details to 5 or 6 requirements. I guess it doesn't help that I'm sort of lost on how to implement these requirements, but I could have done more if I had been more focused. Hopefully my new medicine starts helping me with that a little. That being said, doing version 7 of the todo list in Watch and Code had a lot more meaning for me. I was thinking about how I will apply these skills in my own app once the app gets to the point where I need to connect the JS to the DOM (hope I'm using that terminology right). The Up & Going book from the YDKJS series seems pretty good so far and is some nice supplemental reading.

### Day 18: August 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I looked more at the requirements and did a bunch of research on them, but I'm still not done. However, I did start actually coding a little! Then I took my Pusheen calendar and filled the next 3 months with milestones, goals, and requirements for the project to bring it from a big picture view to a more daily view. This all took awhile, and at the end I spent 28 minutes doing the debugger interlude from Watch and Code.

**Time Spent Coding**: 2h 1m

**Thoughts**: My first time coding for 2+ hours in one day! I finished thinking about most of the MVP requirements, but a lot of the more advanced requirements are so beyond me at this point that I find them hard to even start thinking about. I'm glad I forced myself to actually start coding today though, because I'm worried I'm making excuses to put it off. It's good to get everything down in my calendar but I am nervous I won't be able to keep up with my expectations. At least this will give me a way to put my tasks in a chronological plan, even if I can't keep up with the (sort of arbitrarily chosen) deadlines.

### Day 19: August 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrote methods in my spending tracker app - addTransaction and displayTransactions. Then I spent 23 minutes on Watch and Code and refactored the code so that it used onclick in HTML instead of addEventListener in JS.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 1m

**Thoughts**: I hope I'm going in the right direction with this spending tracker app... I'm kind of just basing it off of the todo list app for now. I'm tired, I woke up early to do this since I'm going to Princeton tonight.

### Day 20: August 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrote the deleteTransaction method for the spending tracker app. Then I completed version 8 of the todo list app from Watch and Code. I took some time at the end to write a README for the todo list app on GitHub.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 8m

**Thoughts**: I should name my spending tracker app so I don't have to keep writing it out. Maybe "Thrift"? I'm sure there is already something called that but I'm going to just call it that privately, in this log and such. It's not like I'm marketing it as an app for others to use or anything. Side note: It is very pleasant to code with a cat curled up on your stomach. The next section on Watch and Code is called "escape the console," and I'm very excited to do just that.

### Day 21: August 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrote an editTransaction method in Thrift to edit properties of the transaction objects. It uses if statements so it can update any number of properties at the same time. For the second half of the hour, I worked on the Watch and Code todo list version 9 - escaping the console! I also updated both these things in GitHub/GitHub Desktop.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 1m

**Thoughts**: I am pretty proud of figuring out that editTransaction method today. One thing I noticed that I'll need to fix is that the code doesn't allow you to remove text from the optional note property once it's been added. The Watch and Code todo list project is teaching me a lot of stuff that will be important for my Thrift project. I am including GitHub updates in my time spent coding because I think these are important exercises for coding.

### Day 22: September 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished version 9 of the Practical JavaScript todo list project, watched the functions within functions interlude, and signed up for Glitch and otherwise prepped to start version 10.

**Time Spent Coding**: 56m

**Thoughts**: I'm tired today after a long day in NYC, so I didn't feel like doing the problem solving required to work on Thrift. I'll get to that tomorrow.

**Link to work**: [Practical JavaScript todo list](https://github.com/smwarsh/practical-js-todo-app)


### Day 23: September 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I brainstormed/problem solved for Thrift to try to figure out (a) the issue in my editTransaction method where you can't delete the text from the optional 'note' property and (b) how to arrange expense vs income in my code. Then I started version 10 of the todo list app in Watch and Code.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: I feel like my brain's wheels are spinning and I can't generate any good ideas. This is the second day in a row that I have not been into coding. Today, I felt depressed all afternoon and evening. I can't tell if I can't figure out good solutions to these problems because I am tired and sad or if I actually can't get it. Hopefully tomorrow I feel better and can get some good ideas.

### Day 24: September 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CODE-A-THON! I did a lot today! I worked on Thrift (largely unsuccessfully), I read You Don't Know JS, I finished versions 10 and 11 of the todo list project and I finished the Watch and Code Practical JavaScript curriculum!

**Time Spent Coding**: 3h 40m

**Thoughts**: I wish I could code this much every day. But even though it was 3h 40m of code, in reality I spent much more time than that on this. I paused the timer every time I answered a text or got sidetracked talking to someone or anything else. I wanted to only count the time I was focused on coding. I usually don't count the YDKJS reading, so the actual coding part was probably closer to 3h. Either way, I did achieve my goal of coding for 3-5 hours. I had another coding existential crisis today. I have hit a roadblock in coding for Thrift, and I really feel like I don't know what to do to move forward. I am tempted to try other routes and basically avoid the issue for now, but I shouldn't. I should stick on the path that Zoe helped me devise and for which I laid out a plan. It's tough because I don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow, stuck as I am with no professor, TA, classmates, or any clear resource to turn to. Googling has gotten me nowhere, and I'm worried I just don't have the knowledge to do something like this project I have set out to do. I know that if I am able to figure it out, I will probably be better for it, but I don't know. I'm worried about stumbling through it and piecing together bits from tutorials and never really understanding. I'm debating subscribing to Watch and Code's premium content, but it's so expensive. See? Crisis. I don't know why I can't just go through 100 Days of Code without worrying about all this stuff. What is the right path to switching my career to web dev? Am I doing the right thing? What if I can't figure it out? What if I fail? These are the things I'm worried about and truly, they're such high-level and big-picture problems that I shouldn't be worrying about them at this stage, but I can't help it! And apparently coding for a longer amount of time exacerbates this type of stress.

### Day 25: September 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the FreeCodeCamp ES6 curriculum for 52 minutes, then worked on troubleshooting the expense/income set up of Thrift for the remaining 44 minutes. 

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 36m

**Thoughts**: The FreeCodeCamp exercises were more challenging today, and I was frustrated. I did eventually figure them out, but I did not have a good time doing it. I didn't know many of the things that they apparently assumed we know. Maybe they were in the Basic JavaScript curriculum and I forgot them, but if not, I feel like they expected me to know more than they taught me. I didn't get much satisfaction from eventually solving the challenge I was having trouble with (higher order arrow functions). Today served to remind me that now, I'm past the stuff I know, and it's not going to be as easy as it has been. As for the spending tracker app, I had an idea to make the categories properties instead of elements of an array which is itself a property of an object. The code is a bit cleaner and easier to use, but it has the same exact problem as the old code. It adds the transaction from addTransaction() to every instance of a category object in the expense AND income objects. The 'this' keyword must be referring back to all these objects at once. The one option I can see right now is to change the category object to a constructor. I don't know if this is a best practice (how could I know? I'm blind here), but I'll try this tomorrow.

### Day 26: September 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the FreeCodeCamp ES6 curriculum for a couple challenges. @cjaredm offered me help with my code and sent me some example code, so I spent a lot of time looking over that.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 0m (ish)

**Thoughts**: Today did not have an auspicious start. My brain was trying to figure out the issues in my code all night when I was trying to sleep! So I was exhausted after a fitful night when I woke up before 6am to code. I was having anxiety and only managed 19 minutes in the morning of the FreeCodeCamp ES6 curriculum. It was a lifesaver when a developer on Twitter offered to help me out. The problems aren't solved exactly, but there's a new light on the situation that gives me hope. I'm eager to go through the rest of this code and see what I can learn. Also, this example code that @cjaredm wrote for me is full of JS syntax that I just learned yesterday or even this morning. I totally agree with Eric, who said today, "how cool that they became applicable right after you learned about them!" *This* is why doing a project is important. I know that. But that doesn't mean it isn't tough.

### Day 27: September 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did one ES6 challenge yesterday before giving in to my fatigue and deciding to take an off day, so that's included in today's challenges. Today I worked on FreeCodeCamp challenges for the entire hour.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: I'm frustrated because I still think we never learned the map, reduce, and filter methods for arrays, so I'm still struggling with them. I'm unsure how the code knows that the parameter is the index of the array. For some reason I struggled with almost every single challenge here. One was especially dumb because I spent probably half an hour on it and the only reason I kept getting it wrong was because I thought the challenge wanted me to change the function into an arrow function like the example, but it didn't. I don't know why this is all so hard for me. I feel like I need to redo this whole curriculum when I finish it, because I need to make sure it actually got through to me. The destructuring is hard. I keep thinking, maybe it's because I'm tired? But that can't be the reason every single night. I think the content is just hard for me.

### Day 28: September 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started looking over the code I printed out, immediately encountered an array function I don't know about, then referred to a tweet by @cjaredm with links to learning these built-in array functions. I got to 10:16 in a video about these array functions, and took a BUNCH of notes. I also referred to [this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) when the video was not being very clear about sort functions.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: I feel guilty, because I meant to advance further with Thrift and even finish looking over the code that @cjaredm sent me, but I didn't even get through one line. However, these array functions have been frustrating me for days now and I think studying them and getting them down will be extremely helpful to me going forward, especially because there seems to be a thing against for loops in JavaScript. It's too bad because I've always liked for loops when coding in Java, but I guess I'd better get out of the habit of using them!

### Day 29: September 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished watching the YouTube video from yesterday and taking notes (30m). I finished the FreeCodeCamp ES6 exercises (41m)! I went over the MDN pages for array iteration methods (26m). Last, I finished going over the code that @cjaredm sent me (1h 25m).

**Time Spent Coding**: 3h 2m

**Thoughts**: I actually ended up doing something like a code-a-thon today! I hit 3 hours of coding, anyway, so I guess it does count! I finally caught up with all the things I was doing. Although I feel guilty for not finishing going through the code that @cjaredm sent me until 5 days after he sent it to me, I think it was really important for me to learn those array iteration methods. They had been causing me frustration for days while working on the FreeCodeCamp exercises, and they were cropping up in other places, like the sample code I was looking at for Thrift. There is a lot more in the ES6 curriculum that I do not feel comfortable with, so I think I want to go through the whole curriculum a second time to make sure I've learned it properly. Some challenges I didn't really understand what I was doing, even though I passed the challenge. I know this will take extra time, but a solid foundation is essential. I'm ready to move forward with my project!

### Day 30: September 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I edited Thrift to integrate the code example from @cjaredm. I credited him. I wrote a display function. I made a calendar plan with small steps for the next week and a half. I went through 2 FreeCodeCamp ES6 challenges.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 2m

**Thoughts**: The code seems so perfect now, with the new strategy from the code example! I'm so glad it's set up this way instead of the old way.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/spending-tracker)


### Day 31: September 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a sortCategoryByDate function for Thrift. Then I prepped questions for the JavaScript meetup at 10pm.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 2m

**Thoughts**: I am so proud of myself! This is the first function I've written entirely on my own for Thrift. The first round of the app was heavily influenced by the Watch and Code Practical JavaScript tutorial. The code I implemented yesterday was mostly copied from @cjaredm's work. I'm am so excited by the success of my first bit of completely original code! Also, I'm very nervous for the meetup, which is in 10 minutes.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://github.com/smwarsh/spending-tracker)


### Day 32: September 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a totalUpCategory function in Thrift that totals the price in each category, and a helper function, roundToPrice, which will round the price accurately to two decimal places and return a string. I did two ES6 FreeCodeCamp exercises.

**Time Spent Coding**: 59m

**Thoughts**: I'm proud of my function today. Not only is it another function that I wrote completely by myself, I'm proud of fixing it once I realized there was a problem. The fix is someone else's code, but I'm proud of the fact that I didn't just say, "Eh, good enough," and leave my code in a state where it was giving a slightly wrong answer. I'm also pleased with how well I am understanding the ES6 challenges this time through. I understand const and let a lot better now after coding with them a bit.

### Day 33: September 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a function totalUpIncomeOrExpense in Thrift to total all the prices in all the categories in income or expense. I also added a bunch more test transactions to the code.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 6m

**Thoughts**: So, I got an error in my code when I tested it, even though I thought I'd done everything right? So I went through the process of what I wanted the function to do, and I debugged it all on my own! I'm proud of that. I'm also proud I figured out how to achieve the end goal of this function (and how to do it without a for loop!). I hope the way I did it is a good way, and not a clunky way? Either way, I'm thrilled that the function appears to work perfectly! I'm also proud that I made it work for income and expense in the same function, instead of having two separate, almost identical functions (DRY!).

### Day 34: September 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a function to calculate the total gain of all transactions in Thrift. I refactored the code according to some feedback from Jared. I looked at the documentation for the Date object and Moment.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 2m

**Thoughts**: I feel good about my code. I know a lot of it will have to be redone when I start connecting it to the DOM, using SQL, etc., but it's still nice for it all to be working right now. Also, the compliments Jared gave me about my code made me feel good too!

### Day 35: September 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed ES6 exercises on FreeCodeCamp. I watched a YouTube video on destructuring. I made a plan for the next chunk of work on Thrift. Also, I listened to a Syntax podcast earlier, "11 Habits of Highly Effective Developers," but I didn't count that in my time spent coding.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 8m

**Thoughts**: Not much coding today, just a tiny bit in the FreeCodeCamp challenges. I understand the topics better this second time through though, so I think this is worthwhile. Visiting Rochester this weekend was nice, and I'm glad I could fit coding in today (took yesterday as my off day).

### Day 36: September 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I chose datefns as the library I want to use to deal with dates in Thrift. I spent awhile trying to figure out how on Earth to use that library in my code?! 

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: I have no idea how to import a library into Glitch. Should I switch to CodeSandbox or CodePen? I checked out the former but it doesn't seem any more obvious there how I'm supposed to do this.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://glitch.com/~pickle-slicer)


### Day 37: September 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I read some more stuff to try to figure out importing datefns. I went through more FreeCodeCamp exercises.

**Time Spent Coding**: 46m

**Thoughts**: Today, my mental health was crap. I did 15 minutes in the morning before work before falling back asleep, 30 minutes at lunch when I came home to get my phone, and not again. I had a really rough night with a bad panic attack and didn't get to finish up the hour. Ugh.

**Link to work**: [FreeCodeCamp exercises 120-124](https://github.com/smwarsh/javascript-exercises)


### Day 38: September 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I tried to figure out how to import date-fns to Thrift.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: Another bad day for my mental health. I could barely get through this hour. I feel like a lot of the hour was wasted on a distracted mind (I didn't have enough medicine today, so I don't think that helped), and fighting my depression. After about 10 minutes, I discovered the dist folder with the files I wanted, but that was the last breakthrough I had. I'm getting a bunch of errors trying to import that file into my program, and there is no good information on how to do this! Maybe one day when I understand it really well, I will write an article explaining how I did it. For beginners. Because I have no idea what I'm doing. It seems like it should be so simple! And once I figure this out, I can go back to the problem solving and function writing that I love. I know that figuring out how to import files and functions is important, but I will I had good resources or guidance on this. And I wish I didn't feel depressed.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://glitch.com/~pickle-slicer)


### Day 39: September 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I moved my code over to CodeSandbox (bye Glitch!), and importing date-fns finally worked! Then I did some thinking in my notebook, then started a little coding towards displaying everything by month.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 9m

**Thoughts**: Today was a lot better. I started off the hour with a success, successfully accessing date-fns after switching over to CodeSandbox. I feel a little guilty, because this is not code I can just put on my website. CodeSandbox did most of the work for me, so when I do take this code for my own and move it to my site, I'm going to have to figure this out all over again. But it felt so good to get past that block! Now I can move on to the fun part - problem solving!

**Link to work**: [Thrift - moved to CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/93m01wq3qo)



### Day 40: September 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I moved over my code from numbers to Date objects to represent the dates and adjusted the sortCategoryByDate function accordingly. I edited the displayCategory function to sort the category by date and format the date before logging it, and also label each category before printing out the transactions. I finished the displayAllByCategory function.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 50m

**Thoughts**: I'm really proud of my code today! It looks so nice now when displaying all the transactions to the console. I'm excited to show it off to Eric when I get a chance. I can tell Jiji appreciates it - she is napping contentedly in my lap. Today was my first day feeling pretty much fully better mentally, and it definitely shows in my coding, in everything from how long I coded to how much fun I had.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://codesandbox.io/s/93m01wq3qo)


### Day 41: September 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did a LOT of brainstorming and problem solving in my notebook. I added some transactions via addTransactions.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 4m

**Thoughts**: I'm very tired tonight.. Adding transactions with the method is probably better for imitating how the program will actually work with user input, instead of hard coding it. I hope my brain decides to rest for the night, because I am still caught up thinking about how to make the addTransaction method work to do a lot more than it does right now.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://codesandbox.io/s/93m01wq3qo)

**Tomorrow**: Do the FreeCodeCamp ES6 curriculum. Start from: "ES6: Write Concise Object Literal Declarations Using Simple Fields." Read the article Leslie sent me. Sign into the Women Who Code Slack workspace. Try to fix displayAllByCategory to adhere to DRY. Display transactions separated by month.

**Ideas**: Change website to use a WordPress CMS. Implement Web Mentions once I get my website on a WordPress CMS. Put website files onto GitHub repository and work in the files on GitHub Desktop? Look up how to do this! Learn about service workers, and implement them. Do a 3-5 hour personal code-a-thon once in every 30 days (Eric's idea). Change addTransaction to do a bunch more stuff, including creating a new month object if that month isn't already there, creating expense or income object within that month, category within that, and transactions array with the added transaction in it! Eek!


### Day 41.5: September 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a little in my notebook and did some thinking.

**Time Spent Coding**: 33m

**Thoughts**: I am not counting today, but I wanted to include it because I feel like it is important to acknowledge how hard it is to code on some days, especially dealing with mental health problems. I felt depressed and anxious and couldn't settle into anything productive towards coding, and I ended up crying and breaking down and going to bed.

**Link to work**: _n/a_


### Day 42: September 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I talked with Jared via Google Hangouts about require/import and some ideas for Thrift.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 5m

**Thoughts**: I'm glad to have a little more background on require and import, and we talked about destructuring as well, which I've been having a little trouble with in the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. I'm also glad I got to talk about Thrift and get some ideas on how to get the code sorted by month (or whatever range). I learned a little more about what SQL does and I'm anxious that it will be too much and too out of the way. I want my program to work like I envision, but I don't want to distract too much from the real goal - learning JavaScript! I guess I will worry about that when I come to it, and stick to JavaScript until then. I normally wouldn't count a conversation like this as my hour of code, but I am trying to get to bed at 9:30 every day until I have to go into New York twice later this week. I'm a bit cramped for time in terms of coding this week, so I'll take what I can get!

### Day 43: September 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished going through FreeCodeCamp's ES6 curriculum for the second time. Then I did some regrouping of thoughts from my call with Jared yesterday

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: Glad to be finished with the ES6 review. I don't know if I want to do the RegEx challenges (which is what the curriculum goes through next), but I guess they'll be helpful. I didn't really feel like working on Thrift today, so I was glad to have FreeCodeCamp to go back to.

**Link to work**: [FreeCodeCamp challenges 125-133](https://github.com/smwarsh/javascript-exercises)


### Day 44: September 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrote an initial version of isolateGroupByRange, which should isolate transactions in a given range of dates.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 2m

**Thoughts**: Today started out without a lot of confidence, but I actually achieved what I wanted to! And successfully did some troubleshooting after getting a bunch of errors. Feels good.

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://codesandbox.io/s/93m01wq3qo)


### Day 45: September 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did a bunch of Regular Expressions Challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: The RegEx challenges are pretty easy to go through, so it's a nice break almost. I will never remember all this, so I'm glad when I do need to use regular expressions at some point that at least I have this base and I can just look up the specifics. Today is day 1 of HPatCC and I'm going into NYC later, so I finished my hour now, at lunch at work.

**Link to work**: [FreeCodeCamp RegEx Challenges, 134-160](https://github.com/smwarsh/javascript-exercises)


### Day 46: September 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished the FreeCodeCamp Regular Expressions curriculum. I messed around a lot with Thrift, changing my old functions to work with a date-sorted view of transactions. Now the transactions all display prettily by date, although they are not in order by date within the range. That's next!

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 36m

**Thoughts**: I dozed a bit during my first 40 minutes of coding, but I was doing my best. I only got 4.5 hours of sleep last night, and this was first thing in the morning. I have to say, I'm pretty pissed with FreeCodeCamp. This is the second time in the RegEx curriculum that the answer to the challenge required knowledge that it hasn't taught you. Once I Googled it, it was clear, but it doesn't teach you before testing you on it! It's ridiculous and frustrating when you think you should know the answer but it's actually not your fault. I coded for way longer than I meant to. Once I started working on Thrift, I got really caught up in it and had a lot of fun solving how to make my program work now that you can isolate transactions by date. Yay!

2. [Thrift](https://codesandbox.io/s/93m01wq3qo)


### Day 47: September 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started & finished FreeCodeCamp's debugging section. I made it so Thrift displays transactions in order by date within the date range. I edited displayEntireGroup function so it would display all of the transactions in the system, regardless of date. I finally fixed displayAllByCategory to adhere to DRY!

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 9m

**Thoughts**: I'm increasingly annoyed with FreeCodeCamp. The debugging section of the course was nothing new, but it had some parts that just didn't make sense at all. They were trying to show the difference between FCC's console and the browser console but the code didn't do what they said it did? Anyway, I was surprised how easily I was able to arrange the transactions in order in Thrift, so that felt good.

### Day 49: October 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrote earliestDateInCategory() and did a bunch of work on earliestDateInGroup().

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 8m

**Thoughts**: I was distractable while coding tonight, so I didn't get as much done as I could have. However, I had a fantastic time problem solving to find the earliest possible date in my code. And everything works as it should so far!

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://codesandbox.io/s/93m01wq3qo)


### Day 50: October 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished writing earliestDateInGroup(), wrote earliestDate(), then wrote the corresponding latest date functions: latestDateInCategory(), latestDateInGroup(), and latestDate(). In the last 10 minutes, I went back to my original plan for the app and checked how many things I have accomplished (22, if you count the console functionality as done!)

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 3m

**Thoughts**: I can't believe it's day 50 already. And I can't believe how far I am in my app. There is only one thing left to do for the MVP. Well (David Tennant voice), actually, there's still a bunch left. I checked off things in pencil that are technically done in the console, but I want them to happen on the webpage. So, I guess that's the next step! The last thing, the one I couldn't check off even a little bit, is that I want everything to be stored in a database. *deep breath* This is going to be tough. I don't want to get too distracted. I think learning a little bit of SQL could help me in the job search, but I don't want to stray too far off the path (of learning JavaScript).

**Link to work**: [Thrift](https://codesandbox.io/s/93m01wq3qo)


### Day 51: October 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I read an article that Leslie (@lesliely9) sent me about hackathons and checked out the tutorial course Jared (@cjaredm) sent me on the Terminal, then started the FreeCodeCamp beginner course on SQL/databases. Later Jared is hosting a JavaScript meetup, which I will attend.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I finally read that article! It's been on my todo list since Leslie sent it to me. I understand everything so far in the SQL course and have learned some good information. I'm already thinking of how I can apply it to Thrift, and I think this will be very useful. Hopefully I learn how to implement the stuff that the instructor is talking about before the end of the course!

### Day 52: October 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I tried to install MySQL... Updated MAMP too.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 4m

**Thoughts**: Databases are always a struggle... The course I'm looking at does not include how to install MySQL on Mac, so I tried to do that the whole hour. Found a new resource at the end of the hour which I hope I can use.

2. [Install MySQL on Mac](https://www.mikedane.com/databases/sql/mysql-mac-installation/)

**Tomorrow**: Get MySQL installed on my computer so I can move on with this tutorial.

**Ideas**: Change website to use a WordPress CMS. Implement Web Mentions once I get my website on a WordPress CMS. Put website files onto GitHub repository and work in the files on GitHub Desktop? Look up how to do this! Learn about service workers, and implement them. Do a 3-5 hour personal code-a-thon once in every 30 days (Eric's idea). Sign into the Women Who Code Slack workspace. Start the FreeCodeCamp Basic Data Structures curriculum. Do the Terminal tutorial that Jared sent me. Implement DRY for isolateGroupByRange functionality, somehow...  Work on the FreeCodeCamp SQL course while also starting to move things in Thrift to the webpage, out from the console. Revist this portion of the Practical JavaScript course to get started.


### Day 53: October 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I got MySQL installed and learned some basic commands.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 11m

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I was able to get MySQL installed and working. SQL seems cool so far. I got 3h 44m of sleep last night so I'm tired. I'm not sure if I did the right thing to show my work via the links, but it was the only export button I could find in PopSQL

### Day 54: October 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I continued with the SQL tutorial. I got to 2:08:38 in the video.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: I watched the Youtube video on my TV while I followed along in PopSQL and took notes in my notebook at my desk. It was nice because I didn't have to keep pausing it. It was like having an extra monitor! I'm bored. I know it's important to learn basic commands in SQL, but I still don't know how to even begin to connect a database to a website. I guess that's more advanced, but I'm impatient to learn that and move forward with coding my project.

### Day 55: October 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I continued with the SQL tutorial. I got to 2:48:41 in the video.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 2m

**Thoughts**: Wow I'm so bored! I want to get back to my project so badly... Actually, the second half of the hour wasn't too bad because I turned his examples into challenges for myself and tested if I knew how to do them before he explained it. But a lot of this tutorial is just copying and pasting his code and following along. I don't know how much learning I'm actually doing.

### Day 56: October 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I continued with the SQL tutorial. I got to 3:17:14 in the video.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 2m

**Thoughts**: I got some good ideas about databases from people on Twitter today. Jared suggested Firebase, which he is trying out. I'm not sure if I want that though. I'd like to see how a relational database works (I believe Firebase is nonrelational), because I think that may be more relevant in a future job. If I have to, though, I'll do that. It has already been almost a week on this SQL course without any help to Thrift, and I miss my project! I want to try to finish the course tomorrow. Only an hour and 3 minutes left! I was pretty distracted today. Also on Twitter, Patricia Feio (@p_feyo) recommended me [SQL Crash Course - Beginner to Intermediate](https://youtu.be/nWeW3sCmD2k) and [Learn Database Design with MySQL From Scratch](https://www.eduonix.com/courses/Web-Development/Learn-Database-Design-with-MySQL-From-Scratch). They said it addresses the link between SQL and JavaScript, which Jared informed me is PHP! Okay, I have some experience in PHP but again, this is not the point of Thrift! I just want to learn JS... I understand now why companies hire different developers for front-end and back-end coding. I just want someone to hook up all this back-end stuff for me! Also, I am noting that a lot of the math and such things that I am doing with JS can be achieved in SQL too, but I am resisting the temptation to learn all that. Trying to stay focused on JavaScript here! P.S. My cat is on my lap and it is very nice.

### Day 57: October 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I continued with the SQL tutorial. I got to 3:42:16 in the video.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 1m

**Thoughts**: I wanted to finish the video today, but I'm so exhausted I don't have the energy to keep going for another 40 minutes of video (however long that translates to in real time). I have to rest up because tomorrow is Wednesday - an early morning and a late night coming home.

### Day 57.5: October 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I continued with the SQL tutorial. I got to 3:55:54 in the video.

**Time Spent Coding**: 19m

**Thoughts**: I coded in the morning before work and planned to do the remaining 41 minutes of code at lunch, but my coworker asked me to get lunch together, and I had ditched him last week so I felt like I couldn't say no. By the time I got home from my 3-hour-round-trip activity at night, I was so exhausted I couldn't bring myself to finish the hour.

### Day 58: October 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished the SQL tutorial! I started making an Entity Relationship (ER) diagram for Thrift.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 1m

**Thoughts**: Glad to be done with the tutorial. I think once I finish the ER diagram I will switch back to working on Thrift for a while before doing the SQL tutorials recommended to me by @p_feyo.

### Day 59: October 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started work on my Day 60 blog post.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: I had to make the blog post writing part of my 100 days of code, because it would never get done if I didn't. Hopefully I can finish it and get it up on my website tomorrow for day 60.

### Day 60: October 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I edited, finished, and posted my Day 60 blog post.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 50m

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I've updated my website. It makes me think how I need to make a navigation bar so I can actually link to my blog and contact pages from the home page. Add it to the list! It was nice to do a little review of how I feel up till now in the challenge. Also, I really miss working on Thrift.

### Day 61: October 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I revisited Watch and Code to remember how to get my JavaScript into the browser. I planned what I want the HTML to be like for Thrift.

**Time Spent Coding**: 54m

**Thoughts**: I was _really_ not into it today. I think it has been too long since I've taken a break (3 weeks). Tomorrow will have to be an off day; I can't get anything done in this state of mind.

**Link to work**: [Watch and Code work](https://github.com/smwarsh/practical-js-todo-app)


### Day 62: October 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I participated in a JavaScript meetup with [Jared](https://twitter.com/cjaredm), [Edward](https://twitter.com/edwardhong527), and [Leslie](https://twitter.com/lesliely9).

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 10m

**Thoughts**: The meetup was fun! I'm hoping it gets me back into the groove, because I took a couple of days off in a row and I'm not proud of it.

**Link to work**: [Jared's tweet about the meetup](https://twitter.com/cjaredm/status/1052270362392715264)


### Day 63: October 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started the FreeCodeCamp Basic Data Structures curriculum.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: I am grudgingly getting back to it. I wanted to work on my project today but couldn't bring myself to do it. I was dragging my feet on these challenges too. I mean, come on, arrays? I've worked a _lot_ with arrays on my project. I know this is cocky of me, but I can't help but to feel above this.

**Link to work**: [FreeCodeCamp Basic Data Structures Challenges, 178-188](https://github.com/smwarsh/javascript-exercises)


### Day 64: October 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished the FreeCodeCamp Basic Data Structures curriculum. I started the first SQL tutorial @p_feyo sent me and got to 7:12.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: I am so tired, and I have a headache. While doing the FreeCodeCamp challenges, I talked myself into going back to SQL tutorials. Thrift needs a database after all, and the more I slog through this stuff, the quicker it will get done.

### Day 65: October 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished the SQL tutorial YouTube video that @p_feyo sent me.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 1m

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I still got this coding done, even though I went into the city today and I'm visiting Eric. I clicked on the link to the other tutorial that Patricia Feio recommended to me, but the link is broken! It's weird, but from what I can see, it looks like the person who makes the tutorials, Brad Traversy, has perhaps left a partnership with one website and started working with Udemy? So I guess I'd have to pay to see the rest of this, which is unfortunate because although Patricia mentioned that it covers connecting SQL with JavaScript, I have learned nothing about this so far.

**Link to work**: [SQL Crash Course - Beginner to Intermediate](https://youtu.be/nWeW3sCmD2k)


### Day 66: October 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started the Eduonix MySQL/PHP tutorial that @p_feyo sent me. I got to 13:45 in the PHP Fundamentals lecture, taking copious notes. I also listened to a 55-minute Syntax podcast, "20 JavaScript Array and Object Methods..." but I did not include that in time spent coding.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 5m

**Thoughts**: This is the first time in over a week that I've actually been into what I'm doing. This tutorial actually seems like it will be applicable to my project! I'm so glad I figured out how to get to the tutorial. For some reason, I get an Error 404 page when I try to open it in Chrome, but luckily Patricia told me it is definitely working, so I opened the link in Safari and it worked! I'm glad I did the previous tutorials, because I'll definitely need those skills, but I'm so happy I've finally found a tutorial that is telling me how to use the database on a website. There is a lot to do before I get to that level with Thrift, though. I tried to put Thrift on localhost and use it, but the JS doesn't seem to be working. I'll have to figure out how to use Thrift outside of CodeSandbox and incorporate the database, PHP, and everything else. It's a big task. For now, I'm just watching, taking lots of notes, and absorbing as much as I can. I didn't want to stop at the end of the hour! As for the podcast I listened to... I don't think I'm much of an aural learner. Even though I knew most of the methods they discussed, I couldn't keep focus or absorb anything they were saying.

### Day 67: October 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I kept working on the MySQL/PHP tutorial and taking notes. I finished "PHP Fundamentals," "Template and Database Connect," and got to 4:15 in "Select and Display Using PHP."

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: The novelty has worn off a little bit and today, while still productive, was not quite as exciting as yesterday. I must be reacting to the sheer difficulty of doing what I'm facing without any guidance. I'm nervous about what's ahead, after I finish this tutorial.

### Day 68: October 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I kept working on the MySQL/PHP tutorial and taking notes. I finished "Select and Display Using PHP" and got to 21:00 in "Insert Data With PHP."

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 1m

**Thoughts**: This is all very useful information.

### Day 69: October 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I kept working on the MySQL/PHP tutorial and taking notes. I finished "Insert Data With PHP" and got to 13:57 in "Update & Delete With PHP."

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 3m

**Thoughts**: I didn't realize there was another tutorial video after the one I finished, so I didn't get to work on Thrift like I thought I would. Oh well, tomorrow!

**Link to work**: [Learn Database Design with MySQL From Scratch](https://www.eduonix.com/courses/Web-Development/Learn-Database-Design-with-MySQL-From-Scratch)


### Day 70: October 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished "Update & Delete With PHP" and with that finished the whole section of the tutorial on how to connect a database to the webpage using PHP. Then, I coded static tables into my HTML for Thrift.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: It feels good to be coding for Thrift again. The last time I worked on it was October 2, over 3 weeks ago.

### Day 71: October 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I called Jared and we worked together (pair programming!) to figure out how to make my JavaScript work outside of CodeSandbox. He showed me how to install/use a bundler, WebPack, and we (he) debugged for a long time. It is finally working!

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 57m

**Thoughts**: I don't understand most of what we did to set this up and get my code working. I need to revisit it, look it over, and think about it. I had to rush out as soon as I got off the call, so I didn't get a chance to reflect on what we did.

**Link to work**: [Thrift: In CodeSandbox for the last time?](https://codesandbox.io/s/93m01wq3qo)


### Day 72: October 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Okay, whew, I did a lot today. I remembered how to log into Cyberduck (that took about 10 min). I put Thrift on stephwarsh.com. I realized that was not the bundled version, so I took the code from the webpack folder on the Desktop and uploaded that instead. While I was waiting for that, I started working on making a navigation bar for my website. I downloaded the latest version of Bootstrap. Something in my CSS is messing it up though, and I didn't have time to figure it out before Thrift finished uploading. Then, I updated Thrift's HTML by copying the content of index.html from Thrift on CodeSandbox. This somehow broke the entire thing, so I went back to before I did that and added HTML little by little. Now, Thrift is up on my website and ready for more work!

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 3m

**Thoughts**: Woohoo! I am proud of all I accomplished today. I only settled in and got everything in order, but I did that, and it works (precariously, it seems, but that's fine). Now it's time for some database-ing!

**Links to work**:
1. I don't have one for my website, but I should really get that on GitHub so I can track my progress in it.
2. [Thrift: On my website!](https://stephwarsh.com/thrift/dist/)


### Day 73: October 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started setting up the database for Thrift on my website. I watched a couple videos and read some documentation trying to get a handle on using dates in the database.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: It was only by extreme force of will that I managed to code for an hour today when all I wanted to do was read my book, _The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue_ by Mackenzi Lee. I guess I'm glad I did it, but still. I'm so nervous that this won't work, but I'm doing okay setting up the database so far. Step by tentative step into the world of back-end development. (Front-end is more fun.)

### Day 74: October 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished adding the tables and started adding rows.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 3m

**Thoughts**: I was excited to actually use some tutorial knowledge IRL! Of course, I had to look it up again... tutorials are basically useless in that way. That's why you've gotta apply it! Side note: I feel like I'm procrastinating doing something actually difficult. Hmm.

**Link to work**: Nothing, it's all in the database for my website and I don't know how to show that here.


### Day 75: October 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I connected the Thrift database to my website.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 5m

**Thoughts**: Wahoo! I can't believe this worked! There was one error, which I debugged, but that just served to assure me that I actually did get this working (it would have been too suspicious if it worked on the first try). Wow. I feel _really_ proud of what I accomplished today. I did not expect the connection to work so smoothly.

**Links to work**:
1. [Thrift code on GitHub](https://github.com/smwarsh/spending-tracker)
2. [Thrift on my website](https://stephwarsh.com/thrift/dist/)

**Tomorrow**: Start figuring out how to display the database on my webpage instead of the static content.

**Ideas**: Change website to use a WordPress CMS. Implement Web Mentions once I get my website on a WordPress CMS. Put website files onto GitHub repository and work in the files on GitHub Desktop? Look up how to do this! Learn about service workers, and implement them. Do a 3-5 hour personal code-a-thon once in every 30 days (Eric's idea). Sign into the Women Who Code Slack workspace. Do the Terminal tutorial that Jared sent me. Implement DRY for isolateGroupByRange functionality, somehow... _Note: I am eligible for another day off between Oct 25 and Nov 9._ Make a navigation bar on my website. Learn CSS Grid.


### Day 76: October 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started echoing the database information onto the webpage.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 7m

**Thoughts**: Wow, information from the database is actually reflected on my webpage! I don't think I've ever accomplished something this cool in coding before. Unfortunately, I realize there are many limitations to what I know how to do now, and I need to figure out how to use JavaScript with all this database info. Otherwise, there will be no date ranges, sums, or any other JavaScript function I've written over these months working on Thrift. The internet suggests I use AJAX, but I don't want to learn _another_ technology. Writing Thrift by myself from scratch is at least as difficult as I predicted, if in different ways than I anticipated.

### Day 77: November 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished echoing the database information onto the webpage. I started adding the hard-coded transactions from my JavaScript file to the database.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 2m

**Thoughts**: I'm so glad I did my coding at lunch. There's something amazing about getting coding done early in the day, or just not having to do it at night. I'm still really excited about the fact that my wimpy little static webpage is doing something as fancy as connecting to a database!

### Day 78: November 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished adding the hard-coded transactions from my JavaScript file to the database, asked Jared for help with the JS/PHP relationship, and I updated the CSS for the Thrift page.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 8m

**Thoughts**: I wasn't sure I was going to be able to code today since friends are coming, and I'm nervous about tomorrow.. Hopefully it works out. As always, I'm glad Jared is helping me. I think my webpage is very ugly and I can't wait to clean it up at the end!

**Links to work**:
1. [Thrift code on GitHub](https://github.com/smwarsh/spending-tracker)
2. [Thrift on my website](https://stephwarsh.com/thrift/dist/)

**Tomorrow**: Consider whatever Jared finds out about the JS/PHP connection. Start figuring out how to add things (do I need AJAX for that too? I'm worried).

**Ideas**: Change website to use a WordPress CMS. Implement Web Mentions once I get my website on a WordPress CMS. Put website files onto GitHub repository and work in the files on GitHub Desktop? Look up how to do this! Learn about service workers, and implement them. Do a 3-5 hour personal code-a-thon once in every 30 days (Eric's idea). Sign into the Women Who Code Slack workspace.

### Day 79: November 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I am considering learning Node.js and doing my research on it before spending $100 on Wes Bos' course.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 11m

**Thoughts**: I took yesterday off because there was not even a free moment for coding, with Anyãh, Brad, and Eric visiting. Today I got in an hour but it was mostly a lot of thinking. I went on Indeed to see if Node is in any job requirements, and it really isn't. It might be best to use Firebase, another suggestion of Jared's (and at least one or two other people).

**Link to work**: [Checking out Wes Bos' course](https://learnnode.com/)


### Day 80: November 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did a lot more thinking today, I talked to Zoe, decided to learn Node.js, and found a potentially good tutorial.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 22m

**Thoughts**: I'm suspicious that the tutorial I found is too good to be true, because it seems like it's exactly what I want and it seems so simple. I'm optimistic despite that though, and I'm looking forward to trying it out. The next few days will be tough because I'm going to Texas for work, then vacation. I'm excited about next steps in my project but I have to make smart decisions the next week about my sleep and such. I might write another blog post, as something I can do on the plane?

**Link to work**: [SitePoint tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/using-node-mysql-javascript-client/)


### Day 81: November 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started the FreeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting curriculum and did 4 challenges

**Time Spent Coding**: 39m

**Thoughts**: I like the challenges in this section! They don't tell you how to do them, so they are actually mentally stimulating! It has been tough to get started back up with coding, even though I probably could have done so a couple of days of my trip to Texas. So, I decided to work on FreeCodeCamp instead of the Node.js tutorial, and did a "half day" to get back into it.

**Link to work**: [FreeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting Challenges, 198-201](https://github.com/smwarsh/javascript-exercises)


### Day 82: November 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did 1 challenge in the FreeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting curriculum.

**Time Spent Coding**: 30m

**Thoughts**: I am finding it very difficult to get back into coding after the break. I am also finding it difficult to code while sick. My brain and body were both moving very slowly today.

**Link to work**: [FreeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting Challenges, 202](https://github.com/smwarsh/javascript-exercises)


### Day 83: November 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did 6 challenges in the FreeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting curriculum.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: I feel a lot sharper today.

**Link to work**: [FreeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting Challenges, 203-208](https://github.com/smwarsh/javascript-exercises)


### Day 84: November 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I finally decided to teach myself Firebase. I watched a video and a half by Firebase on Youtube to intorduce myself to it (I got to 9:19 in the second video).

**Time Spent Coding**: 55m

**Thoughts**: I was falling asleep while watching the second video, so I decided to call it quits for the day and continue tomorrow.

### Day 85: November 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I rewatched the first half of the second video from yesterday (I got to 6:50) and did 3 FreeCodeCamp challenges from the Basic Algorithm Scripting curriculum

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 13m

**Thoughts**: I liked the FreeCodeCamp challenges today. They took me a long time but I feel like I learned a lot from them.

**Today's Progress**: I finished rewatching the second video on Cloud Firestore and did 1 FreeCodeCamp challenge from the Basic Algorithm Scripting curriculum and got deep into a second, the last one.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 4m

**Thoughts**: Is Cloud Firestore the same thing as Firebase? And why can't I get this last dang challenge on FreeCodeCamp?

### Day 87: November 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I explained my project predicament to Michaela for half an hour! She told me to buy the Node.js course and learn it. I finished the Basic Algorithm Scripting curriculum on FreeCodeCamp, and I bought the Node.js course from Wes Bos.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 2m

**Thoughts**: I apparently can't make any decisions. I'm gonna learn Node.js. I didn't intend to delve into backend programming, but I can't say it hasn't been at least a little fun... So here I am. Maybe I'll be a full stack developer someday. I'm going to put Thrift on hold for awhile until I finish this Node.js project in this course. Another thing - I worked for so long on that last FreeCodeCamp challenge. Eventually, I gave in and looked at the answer. Turns out the console is a scheming jerk! I had it right the whole time! My solution is actually the "Intermediate Code Solution" on the solutions page, so I am quite proud of myself.

### Day 88: November 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Happy Thanksgiving! I started Wes Bos' Node.js course, but I may have to totally restart it, I don't know.

**Time Spent Coding**: 39m

**Thoughts**: I tried to do all those edits and everything while working in the master branch on GitHub... Ugh. I didn't realize I had to fork it. I thought cloning it to GitHub Desktop would do that for me. I am woefully inexperienced. Also, I have almost no space left on my computer to be downloading all this new stuff. Oops.

**Link to work**: [Learn-Node on GitHub](https://github.com/smwarsh/Learn-Node)


### Day 89: November 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did the "Starter Files and Environmental Variables" video of Learn Node.

**Time Spent Coding**: 56m

**Thoughts**: Today was extremely frustrating, I got all kinds of Terminal errors and spent a long time downloading all kinds of npm node modules, and I'm still getting errors, and tomorrow I'm just going to restart the whole thing - wait, I just checked localhost:7777 like he says to at the end of the video, and it says "Hey! It works!" in the browser just like it's supposed to. Caitlin told me I just said a really inspiring quote out loud, which was this: "I thought I was gonna restart but now I’m just going to keep on stumbling through," which is how I feel... This is so much trouble.

**Link to work**: [Learn-Node on GitHub](https://github.com/smwarsh/Learn-Node)


### Day 90: November 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I redid the first 3 Learn Node videos, but I'm still getting errors.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 0m

**Thoughts**: Okay, I redid everything, but I'm getting the same errors. Tomorrow I'll have to do some Googling and maybe even post in the Slack.

**Link to work**: [dang-thats-delicious on GitHub](https://github.com/smwarsh/dang-thats-delicious)

**Tomorrow**: Troubleshoot & post in Slack.

**Ideas**: Change website to use a WordPress CMS. Implement Web Mentions once I get my website on a WordPress CMS. Put website files onto GitHub repository and work in the files on GitHub Desktop? Look up how to do this! Learn about service workers, and implement them. Do a 3-5 hour personal code-a-thon once in every 30 days (Eric's idea). Sign into the Women Who Code Slack workspace. Do the Terminal tutorial that Jared sent me. Implement DRY for isolateGroupByRange functionality, somehow... Make a navigation bar on my website. Learn CSS Grid. _Note: This fortnight ends Nov 26._
