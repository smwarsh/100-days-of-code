# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Refamiliarized myself with GitHub, changed username to smwarsh so it will be consistent across platforms, refamiliarized myself with basic terminal commands, updated my website for the first time since August 2017! Made new "Blog" page on my website with a post about my expectations and goals for this challenge.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 32m

**Thoughts:** I'm frustrated. I made a new page for my website because I just want a simple dumb text page to put this blog post on (I'll make it pretty later). It looks silly with only the basic formatting that I already have in my CSS for my site, so I added some new classes and called them in CSS, etc. But for some reason, although the CSS pretends to be updated, it's not. I even put the new CSS file online because I thought it might be a MAMP issue, but there is no sign of any edits when I look at the page source. But when I download the file from Cyberduck, the edits ARE in the file! I'm baffled! I'm usually very good at figuring out these types of problems, after being a lab TA for an intro to web design class for so long, but I'm stumped. Maybe it's just taking awhile to sync? I can't figure it out.

### Day 2: August 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for FreeCodeCamp and started Basic JavaScript curriculum. Did 36 challenges. Also took the new coders survey and uploaded my challenges to GitHub.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 10m

**Thoughts**: I can't believe I didn't do this a year ago. It's so easy to just sit down and code. Today was all review and quite easy, but I feel like this time I will get past the JavaScript basics, so hopefully this is my last time "learning" them.

### Day 3: August 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I updated some small things on my website so it doesn't say I'm a student in Rochester anymore! I fixed up the blog page quite a bit: added hyperlinks, tested and fixed them, styled the page, looked up a bunch of CSS stuff as a refresher while doing this. In the last bit of the hour I did 14 Basic JavaScript challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 5m

**Thoughts**: My suspicions were correct! It was the cache all along that was keeping me from seeing my updates to the CSS on my website. Evil cache! I'm glad I figured that out and was able to update my site. Doing work on my website is far more fun and engaging than doing the exercises on FreeCodeCamp in JavaScript, but I know I have to keep plugging away at the JavaScript if I want to become a competitive job candidate for a web dev job.

### Day 4: August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Basic JavaScript course in FreeCodeCamp for half an hour. Then I started and completed the Basic HTML course under the Responsive Web Design Certification in FreeCodeCamp for the rest of the time.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 7m

**Thoughts**: I feel like there is so much to do, and only coding for an hour a day won't be fast enough! But doing just a little bit every day is still getting something done, and I am proud of that. The JS course is still all review, although there was one challenging task where I had to remember the pop and shift functions from last time. I was pleased when I got it right! The HTML course was, of course, review, but I was surprised how much I got from it. I learned a couple small new things, learned some best practices, and got a good review of forms. I wish the info on forms was more comprehensive. It doesn't give you the information to actually send form submissions to an email or website and receive them there, which is a problem if you actually want to make a form yourself.

**Tomorrow**: Continue Basic JavaScript curriculum on FreeCodeCamp, start Basic CSS curriculum, create a contact form on my website (How do you make the form send data to yourself? Look this up)

**Ideas**: Implement Web Mentions once I get my website on a WordPress CMS. Create a contact form on my website.



### Day 5: August 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Basic JavaScript course in FreeCodeCamp for half an hour. For the rest of the time, I worked on a contact form for my website. I wanted to start the Basic CSS curriculum too, but I need to keep this to two projects at a time. Oops, started that later in the afternoon. Forgot about the 2 project rule and got too excited!

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 22m

**Thoughts**: The JavaScript challenges required a little more independent thinking and coding today, which was nice. Everything is still review, but I don't resent the review. I'd be lost without it. There is so much to consider for a contact form for my website. For one thing, I need to figure out how to make the textarea box responsive to page size. When I tested it on a smaller page width, it broke the boundaries of the container. So, I just left it very small for now. This is definitely something I have to look into.

### Day 6: August 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Basic JavaScript course in FreeCodeCamp for 15 minutes in the morning, then another 15 minutes at lunch. For the rest of lunch, I worked on the contact form. I tried to make the PHP form processor using an old lab from college, but it didn't work (I didn't expect it to). So I started [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q0gYjAVonI) and got to 4:09.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 3m

**Thoughts**: The JavaScript is new now! This is good, but I feel like FreeCodeCamp isn't teaching me very well, like I couldn't practically use these aspects of JavaScript on my own. I wish there were a small assignment, like a lab assignment, where I could practice the things I've learned so far. There is a lot to do for the contact form. I know a contact form will be a readily available plugin once I move my site over to a WordPress CMS, but I think it's a good exercise to build one from scratch. Hopefully the video I'm watching will help me get it working.

### Day 7: August 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Basic JavaScript curriculum on FreeCodeCamp for half an hour, then spent the rest of the time rewriting the PHP form processor for my contact form and debugging it.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 48m

**Thoughts**: Today was much more challenging than previous days. For one thing, the JavaScript required a lot of careful thinking, and I'm going a lot more slowly now that the material is new. One good thing - I got a recommendation from someone on Twitter for another JavaScript learning curriculum with projects that I can try. I want to practically apply the stuff I'm learning and I don't know how, so this might help. For the contact form, I'm having a lot of trouble with it and it's frustrating. For much of the time I struggled with an Error 500, and I honestly don't even know how I fixed it. But I'm relieved it's fixed and I'm on to a more common problem: The form appears to be working but I'm not receiving the email. I'll check my inbox again tomorrow... I hope it's just taking awhile to go through, because I'm not looking forward to continuing the debugging process.

### Day 8: August 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Basic JavaScript curriculum on FreeCodeCamp for 45 minutes, then spent the rest of the time debugging my contact form code. I scrapped everything, started it from scratch, and now it works!

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 48m

**Thoughts**: I got stuck on something in the Basic JavaScript course so I was working on it for over 30 minutes, but I reached challenge 100! It feels good to be challenged by this new material. As for the contact form, I can't even describe how relieved I felt when that first message came through to my email after rewriting the entire code from scratch. I don't know what was wrong with it before, but I'm so happy I finally figured it out.

**Tomorrow**: Continue Basic JavaScript curriculum on FreeCodeCamp. Start making the contact form yours, slowly and carefully, testing it frequently to make sure it still works.

**Ideas**: Change website to use a WordPress CMS. Implement Web Mentions once I get my website on a WordPress CMS. Look up how to make the textarea in my contact form responsive to page widths (use CSS?). Start [Gordon Zhu's Practical JavaScript course](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) after finishing the FreeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript curriculum. Put website files onto GitHub repository and work in the files on GitHub Desktop? Look up how to do this! Learn about service workers, and implement them.


### Day 9: August 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Basic JavaScript curriculum on FreeCodeCamp! Then I started Gordon Zhu's Practical JavaScript course. After that, I worked on improving the style of my contact form.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 16m

**Thoughts**: I'm happy I finished the Basic JavaScript course, and the Practical JavaScript course looks promising. I'm looking forward to working on an actual project and applying my knowledge of JavaScript. I'm still having issues with my site not updating as I work on it, so I've been having to use my phone browser to make sure the changes are actually being implement and to test that the contact form is still working (it is). That's annoying, but it's still fun to work with CSS.

### Day 10: August 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I continued Gordon Zhu's Practical JavaScript course and completed version 1 of the app, using the console in the browser. Then, I styled my contact form and watched [a video](https://youtu.be/E5MEzC0prd4), which I hoped would tell me how to do error handling but has not so far. I got to 25:50.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 1m

**Thoughts**: My site not updating when I'm editing it is getting really bothersome. I basically have to code blind and hope it's working. I wish I knew how to make it work consistently. Other thoughts: this is probably the hardest time I've had doing this so far. I am so tired I kept nearly falling asleep and I was afraid I wouldn't be able to finish the hour

### Day 11: August 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did V2 of the todo list in the Practical JavaScript course, working in the console. Then I watched some videos, like , starting to figure out how to do error handling on my PHP contact form.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 12m

**Thoughts**: I'm getting a little bored of these projects. None of the JavaScript is new to me, and it seems odd to be coding in the browser console. It doesn't save my code, obviously, so when I ran out of time at lunch and picked up again after work, all that code was lost and I didn't feel like rewriting to continue following along. I also have less of a clear path forward with my form. It works now, so should I focus on perfecting the CSS? Implementing error handling? Security? Is that last one even a thing? I need more of a purpose in these two projects.

### Day 12: August 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I looked into PHP form error handling without using an include, then decided to just be done with and move on from the contact form project. I spent the rest of the hour working on the Practical JavaScript course. I wanted to put the code I wrote on GitHub, so I spent half an hour figuring out how to do that and refamiliarizing myself with GitHub Desktop.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 33m

**Thoughts**: I coded for a lot longer than I expected! It was really hard to get started today. I was feeling depressed, which is the first time I've experienced that obstacle in 100 Days of Code, but I know it won't be the last. I managed 40m of coding before taking a break. I was feeling much better by the time I returned to it later. I coded each of the todo list functions and methods before watching the video tutorial, and I was really pleased to get them all right for the most part! (They were correct in the important ways.) So I was in a good mood by the time I finished the hour. The rest of the time, I relearned how to use GitHub Desktop and I put today's work on GitHub. I feel good!

### Day 13: August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did Watch and Code todo list project version 4.

**Time Spent Coding**: 56m

**Thoughts**: I'm exhausted. I hope I'm not burning myself out, but this coding is one of the main things that makes me feel a sense of purpose in my life now. So, I'm proud I coded tonight. My eyelids kept closing but luckily several of the topics (for loops, for example) were review so I think I'll be fine. I did well attempting to write the code before he showed us how, although not quite as well as yesterday, which is good because it means the course is challenging me more now.

### Day 14: August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did Watch and Code todo list project version 5 and started version 6.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 10m

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I don't feel as sick today (I took yesterday off because I was so spent), but I'm definitely tired and wasn't on the ball with knowing the answers ahead of time like I usually do. Hopefully another good night's sleep tonight will get me on a better track for tomorrow.

### Day 15: August 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished Watch and Code todo list version 6 and spent a lot of time in the "Data Types and Comparisons" interlude (I finished that too).

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 12m

**Thoughts**: The "Data Types and Comparisons" was hard! I got a couple of the examples wrong, even though I wrote out the diagram like he said to do. At least I think I understand it all, even though I got it wrong at first. It's nice to know how to code in JavaScript, but I'm starting to think about how it would be nice to learn how to use it in real life, like on my website for example. I have no idea how to connect it to HTML or CSS or anything else. We're 100% using the console currently.

### Day 16: August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I decided to create a budget tracker web app! Yesterday, off the clock, I wrote a rough draft of the requirements for the app. Today, I made the requirements more detailed and specific, and I started going through them and thinking about what each requirement actually entailed. I also marked out which requirements I think are necessary to create the minimum viable product (MVP) version of the app.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 9m

**Thoughts**: I didn't actually do any coding today, but this may be even more valuable than all the previous days where I was following tutorials and coding within that structure. Today, I started my first JavaScript project! My budget tracker app. I have experienced a lot of conflict over the last day or two since Zoe provided the inspiration for this project idea (she mentioned doing something about finance, because I'm interested in that topic, and I had the idea to recreate my current Excel spreadsheet in a more convenient and user friendly form). I've been thinking about it constantly. This is a huge project, and I'm nervous I won't be able to finish it within the timeline we set (3 months). But I'm going to do my best. Hopefully what I worked on today will provide a solid foundation for the project's success.

### Day 17: August 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I elaborated on a few more requirements for my budget tracker app in my notebook at lunch. After work, I did version 7 of the Watch and Code todo list app. I also started reading the first book in the You Don't Know JS book series by Kyle Simpson, Up & Going, but I didn't include this in the time spent coding. I'm still in the first chapter.

**Time Spent Coding**: 1h 21m

**Thoughts**: I wish I could have been more focused on my requirements for the budget tracker app. I worked on it for almost half an hour and only added details to 5 or 6 requirements. I guess it doesn't help that I'm sort of lost on how to implement these requirements, but I could have done more if I had been more focused. Hopefully my new medicine starts helping me with that a little. That being said, doing version 7 of the todo list in Watch and Code had a lot more meaning for me. I was thinking about how I will apply these skills in my own app once the app gets to the point where I need to connect the JS to the DOM (hope I'm using that terminology right). The Up & Going book from the YDKJS series seems pretty good so far and is some nice supplemental reading.

### Day 18: August 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I looked more at the requirements and did a bunch of research on them, but I'm still not done. However, I did start actually coding a little! Then I took my Pusheen calendar and filled the next 3 months with milestones, goals, and requirements for the project to bring it from a big picture view to a more daily view. This all took awhile, and at the end I spent 28 minutes doing the debugger interlude from Watch and Code.

**Time Spent Coding**: 2h 1m

**Thoughts**: My first time coding for 2+ hours in one day! I finished thinking about most of the MVP requirements, but a lot of the more advanced requirements are so beyond me at this point that I find them hard to even start thinking about. I'm glad I forced myself to actually start coding today though, because I'm worried I'm making excuses to put it off. It's good to get everything down in my calendar but I am nervous I won't be able to keep up with my expectations. At least this will give me a way to put my tasks in a chronological plan, even if I can't keep up with the (sort of arbitrarily chosen) deadlines.

**Tomorrow**: Finish thinking about each requirement and writing notes! Set up transaction (as object or array within object? Probably the latter). Watch and Code todo list app version 8.

**Ideas**: Change website to use a WordPress CMS. Implement Web Mentions once I get my website on a WordPress CMS. Put website files onto GitHub repository and work in the files on GitHub Desktop? Look up how to do this! Learn about service workers, and implement them. Add media queries to my contact page. Do a personal code-a-thon once in every 30 days (Eric's idea).
